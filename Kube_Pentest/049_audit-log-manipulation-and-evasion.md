# Kubernetes Audit Log Manipulation and Evasion Vulnerability

## 1. Overview Section

### Attack Vector Description

An attacker who has gained sufficient privileges within a Kubernetes cluster can attempt to manipulate or evade the audit logging system. This involves altering audit log configurations, directly manipulating log files (if accessible), or generating events designed to overwhelm or mislead the logging system, effectively obscuring malicious activity. This is a critical vulnerability as audit logs are a primary security control for detecting and investigating security incidents within the cluster.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

Successful audit log manipulation or evasion allows an attacker to operate undetected within the cluster. This can lead to:

*   **Data breaches:** Exfiltration of sensitive data without triggering alerts.
*   **Privilege escalation:** Continued and undetected escalation to higher privileges.
*   **System compromise:** Installation of backdoors and malicious code that remain hidden.
*   **Denial of service:**  Deliberately flooding logs to overwhelm the system and hide malicious activities within the noise.
*   **Regulatory non-compliance:** Failure to meet audit requirements due to incomplete or unreliable logs.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical**

The ability to disable or manipulate audit logs directly undermines the security monitoring and incident response capabilities of the cluster. Successful exploitation can have severe consequences, making this a critical risk.

### Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists

The vulnerability can arise from several factors:

*   **Insufficient Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Overly permissive RBAC policies grant users or service accounts the ability to modify audit policy configurations or access the underlying audit log storage.
*   **Misconfigured Audit Policies:** Poorly designed audit policies may exclude important events from being logged or fail to capture sufficient detail for forensic analysis.
*   **Direct Access to Log Storage:** If the attacker gains access to the storage backend where audit logs are stored (e.g., through compromised credentials or a storage system vulnerability), they can directly modify the log files.
*   **Exploitable Kubernetes API Vulnerabilities:**  Rare, but possible, exploits in the Kubernetes API server might allow bypassing audit logging mechanisms.
*   **Container Escape with Host Access:** If an attacker can escape a container and gain access to the host system where the Kubernetes control plane is running, they might be able to directly manipulate audit log files or configurations.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Sufficient Privileges:** The attacker needs sufficient RBAC privileges to view and potentially modify audit policies, access the audit log storage, or interact with the Kubernetes API server in a way that can impact logging.  Specifically, permissions to view and `update` the `auditpolicies` resource, and read access to the audit log directory.
*   **Knowledge of Audit Policy Configuration:** Understanding of how audit policies are defined and configured is crucial for identifying weaknesses and developing effective evasion strategies.
*   **Access to the Cluster:** The attacker needs access to the Kubernetes cluster through `kubectl`, API calls, or direct access to the nodes (via SSH or similar).
*   **Log Storage Location:** Knowledge of where the audit logs are stored is required. This could be a local file system, a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk), or a cloud-based storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

This section describes steps for validating and exploiting audit log manipulation and evasion vulnerabilities.

**Phase 1: Validation (Determining Audit Policy and Access)**

**Step 1: Check Current Audit Policy (Attempt 1 - API)**

```bash
kubectl get auditpolicies.audit.k8s.io --all-namespaces -o yaml
```

*   **Explanation:**  This command retrieves all AuditPolicy objects in all namespaces.  AuditPolicies define the rules used to generate audit logs.
*   **Why:** To determine the existing audit policy, which is essential to identify potential gaps or weaknesses that can be exploited for evasion.  Understanding the current policy allows you to craft attacks that will not be logged, or will generate "noise" to obfuscate the real malicious activity.
*   **Expected Output:** A YAML representation of the AuditPolicy objects, including rules and other configurations.
*   **What to Look For:** Pay close attention to the `rules` section, specifically the `level` field (e.g., `Metadata`, `RequestResponse`), the `verbs` (e.g., `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`), and the `resources` (e.g., `pods`, `deployments`, `secrets`).  Identify any critical actions or resources that are not being audited or are being audited at a low level.
*   **Contribution:**  Provides a baseline understanding of the current audit logging configuration. If this fails due to permissions, attempt Step 2.
*   **Alternative approaches:** If the `auditpolicies` resource is not available, it suggests that audit policies are not managed using Kubernetes CRDs. Instead, the audit policy might be configured via command-line flags to the kube-apiserver (see Step 2 for validation).

**Step 2: Check Kube-apiserver Configuration (Attempt 2 - process flags on Control Plane node)**

```bash
# Connect to the Control Plane Node (e.g. via SSH)
# Replace with your Control Plane hostname or IP
ssh <control_plane_user>@<control_plane_ip>

# Find the kube-apiserver process and inspect its flags
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

# Example Output (showing snippet of interest)
# /usr/local/bin/kube-apiserver --audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml --audit-log-path=/var/log/kubernetes/audit.log --audit-log-maxsize=100 --audit-log-maxbackup=3
```

*   **Explanation:**  This command requires SSH access to the Control Plane node. First, it lists all running processes and filters for the `kube-apiserver` process. Then, it identifies the process flags which may contain the path to the audit policy file (`--audit-policy-file`) and other relevant audit configuration parameters.
*   **Why:** If `kubectl get auditpolicies` doesn't work (e.g., RBAC restrictions, the audit policy is not managed as a CRD), the audit policy is likely configured directly through the kube-apiserver command-line flags. This step allows you to find the audit policy file and its location on the node.
*   **Expected Output:** Output from `ps -ef` containing the command line arguments for `kube-apiserver`.
*   **What to Look For:** Specifically, look for the `--audit-policy-file` flag. This indicates the location of the audit policy file. Also look for `--audit-log-path`, `--audit-log-maxsize`, and `--audit-log-maxbackup` flags as these will be needed later for evasion.
*   **Contribution:**  Determines the location and configuration of the audit policy if CRDs are not used. If no audit policy file is configured, it means auditing is either disabled or using default, very basic logging.  This represents a significant vulnerability.

**Step 3: Examine the Audit Policy File (if found in Step 2)**

```bash
# Assuming the audit policy file is located at /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
```

*   **Explanation:**  This command displays the contents of the audit policy file.  Requires root privileges to read the file.
*   **Why:** To analyze the rules defined in the audit policy file and identify potential weaknesses for evasion. This is the same goal as Step 1, but using the actual audit policy file located on the control plane node.
*   **Expected Output:** The YAML content of the `/etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml` file.
*   **What to Look For:**  Examine the `rules` section. Look for omissions, such as:
    *   Critical verbs like `create`, `update`, and `delete` are not being audited for certain resources.
    *   Resources with high security impact (e.g., `secrets`, `configmaps`, `roles`, `rolebindings`, `clusterroles`, `clusterrolebindings`) are not being audited.
    *   Audit level is set to `None` or `Metadata` for crucial events, reducing the amount of information logged.
*   **Contribution:**  Provides detailed information about the existing audit logging configuration, including what is being logged and at what level.  Allows for identifying potential evasion opportunities.

**Step 4: Identify Audit Log Storage Location (if not identified in Step 2)**

```bash
# Inspect kube-apiserver logs for audit log path (another method)
sudo journalctl -u kube-apiserver | grep "audit-log-path"

# Alternative: Inspect static pod manifest for kube-apiserver
sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep "audit-log-path"

# Example if audit logs are sent to a centralized system, not a file.
# Check the logging configuration files on the nodes (e.g. rsyslog.conf, fluentd.conf)
sudo cat /etc/rsyslog.conf | grep "audit"
```

*   **Explanation:**  This command attempts to find the audit log file path. If not directly defined in `--audit-policy-file` in the kube-apiserver's flags, inspect the kube-apiserver logs (using `journalctl`) or the static pod manifest on the control plane node. Also check logging configuration files, such as `rsyslog.conf` if centralized logging is configured.
*   **Why:** Knowing where the audit logs are stored is crucial for exploiting log manipulation vulnerabilities. If the logs are stored locally, direct manipulation might be possible. If they are sent to a centralized system, other evasion techniques might be more effective.
*   **Expected Output:** The path to the audit log file or an indication that logs are being forwarded to a centralized logging system.
*   **What to Look For:** The `--audit-log-path` flag in the kube-apiserver logs or manifest file. If the logs are being forwarded, identify the destination (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk, cloud storage).
*   **Contribution:**  Determines the location of the audit logs, which is essential for exploitation.

**Phase 2: Exploitation (Attempting Log Evasion and/or Manipulation)**

**Scenario 1: Exploiting Missing Audit Rules**

**Step 5: Attempt to Create a Secret Without Being Logged (if Secrets Creation not logged or logged at a low level)**

```bash
# Assuming 'secrets' resource is not adequately logged in the audit policy
kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=key=value
```

*   **Explanation:** Creates a Kubernetes Secret.
*   **Why:** To test if the absence of specific audit rules can be exploited to perform actions without generating adequate audit logs. If the secret is created without being logged, it confirms the vulnerability.
*   **Expected Output:** `secret/my-secret created`
*   **What to Look For:** Check the audit logs for events related to the creation of the `my-secret` secret. If the event is missing, or if the log level is `Metadata` or lower, it indicates a successful evasion.
*   **Contribution:**  Validates the possibility of evading the audit log by performing actions that are not adequately logged.
*   **Verification:**
    ```bash
    # Example: Check audit logs if stored in a file
    sudo grep "my-secret" /var/log/kubernetes/audit.log

    # Example: Check audit logs in Elasticsearch (replace with your actual query)
    # GET _search
    # {
    #   "query": {
    #     "match": {
    #       "requestURI": "/api/v1/namespaces/default/secrets"
    #     }
    #   }
    # }
    ```
* **Potential variation:**  If creating a secret directly is logged at a low level (e.g., Metadata), attempt to update an existing secret with sensitive data. The "update" verb might not be logged as thoroughly.

**Scenario 2: Overwhelming the Audit Log**

**Step 6: Generate a Large Volume of Audit Events (Log Flooding)**

```bash
# This is a simplified example. A real attack would involve more sophisticated techniques.
for i in {1..1000}; do
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces > /dev/null
done
```

*   **Explanation:** This script repeatedly executes the `kubectl get pods` command to generate a large number of audit events.  This can be made more impactful by targeting specific resources which are known to generate verbose logs.
*   **Why:** To attempt to overwhelm the audit logging system with noise, making it difficult to identify malicious activity within the flood of logs.  This assumes that the audit logs have a limited size or storage.
*   **Expected Output:**  The `kubectl get pods` command will execute repeatedly, generating a large number of audit events.  The actual output displayed will be dependent on the cluster, but the critical result is an increased volume of log data.
*   **What to Look For:** Check the audit log size and performance. If the logs are being stored locally, the log file size might increase rapidly. If logs are being sent to a centralized system, the system's performance might degrade. After the flooding, attempt to identify the "my-secret" entry from Step 5 (or any other malicious activity), to see if the flooding made it more difficult to find.
*   **Contribution:** Demonstrates the possibility of using log flooding to obscure malicious activities.
*   **Potential variation:** The script can be modified to target specific API endpoints known to generate verbose logs, increasing the impact of the flooding. For example, repeatedly querying the status of a high-traffic service.

**Scenario 3: Direct Log Manipulation (Requires Access to Log Files - High Privilege)**

**Step 7: Modify Audit Log Files (If Accessible)**

```bash
# This step requires direct access to the audit log file on the node.  Very dangerous and detectable!

# Stop the kube-apiserver to prevent new logs from being written during manipulation.  (DO NOT do this on production unless you know what you're doing!!!)
sudo systemctl stop kube-apiserver

# Back up the original audit log file.
sudo cp /var/log/kubernetes/audit.log /var/log/kubernetes/audit.log.bak

# Edit the audit log file to remove or modify suspicious entries (e.g., using 'sed' or a text editor).
sudo sed -i '/my-secret/d' /var/log/kubernetes/audit.log

# Restart the kube-apiserver.  (DO NOT do this on production unless you know what you're doing!!!)
sudo systemctl start kube-apiserver
```

*   **Explanation:** This command requires root access to the node where the audit logs are stored. It first stops the kube-apiserver, backs up the audit log file, edits the log file to remove suspicious entries, and then restarts the kube-apiserver.
*   **Why:**  To demonstrate the ability to directly manipulate the audit logs if the attacker has sufficient privileges.  This is highly destructive and easily detectable if not done carefully.
*   **Expected Output:** The log file will be modified to remove the specified entries.
*   **What to Look For:** The audit logs will no longer contain the entries that were removed or modified.
*   **Contribution:** Demonstrates the most direct form of audit log manipulation, which is only possible with high privileges.
*   **Warning:**  This step can have severe consequences and should only be performed in a controlled environment with proper precautions.  Stopping the kube-apiserver will disrupt the cluster.

## Remediation Recommendations

*   **Implement Strict RBAC Policies:** Restrict access to audit policy configurations and audit log storage based on the principle of least privilege. Regularly review and update RBAC policies.
*   **Design Comprehensive Audit Policies:** Ensure that all critical events and resources are being audited at an appropriate level. Consider using different audit levels for different types of events to reduce log volume.
*   **Secure Audit Log Storage:** Protect the audit log storage backend with strong authentication and access controls. Consider using encryption to protect the confidentiality of the logs.
*   **Implement Log Integrity Monitoring:** Use tools to detect unauthorized modifications to audit log files.
*   **Centralize Audit Logging:** Forward audit logs to a centralized logging system for secure storage and analysis. Consider using a security information and event management (SIEM) system to monitor audit logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Regularly Review Audit Logs:** Analyze audit logs for anomalies and indicators of compromise.
*   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent log flooding attacks.
*   **Rotate and Archive Audit Logs:** Regularly rotate and archive audit logs to prevent them from being overwritten.
*   **Enable Auditing of Audit Configuration Changes:** Audit any changes made to the audit policy itself.
*   **Use an immutable log storage solution:** Where possible, consider storing audit logs in an immutable storage solution. This could include things like write-once-read-many (WORM) storage on physical media or a blockchain-based audit trail. This significantly increases the difficulty for attackers to successfully modify logs.
*   **Regularly scan the control plane nodes for unusual processes or files:** Check that there are no unexpected files or processes on the control plane nodes that could indicate compromise.
