# Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler Manipulation Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the vulnerability associated with manipulating the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler (CA) to trigger excessive or unintended scaling events, leading to resource exhaustion, denial of service (DoS), and potentially financial impact due to increased cloud provider costs.

### Attack Vector Description

An attacker can leverage misconfigured resource requests and limits within deployed applications to trick the Cluster Autoscaler into believing that the current cluster capacity is insufficient. By carefully crafting workloads with inflated resource requirements, an attacker can force the CA to rapidly scale up the cluster by adding new nodes. In more advanced scenarios, if the attacker can influence application deployments and their resource definitions, they can directly control the scaling behavior.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The cluster becomes overloaded with unnecessary nodes, consuming resources and potentially causing legitimate applications to fail due to resource contention.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Rapid scaling can exhaust the available resources within the cloud provider account (e.g., exceeding VM instance limits, running out of IP addresses), leading to service disruptions.
*   **Financial Impact:** Unnecessary scaling leads to significant cost increases due to the consumption of additional cloud provider resources.
*   **Information Disclosure (indirect):** Observing the behavior of the autoscaler under different resource requests can reveal details about resource allocation policies and limits.

### Risk Level Assessment

**High** -  Successful exploitation can easily lead to a denial of service and significant financial consequences. The impact is high, and exploitation complexity is often moderate, especially if the attacker has some control over application deployment configurations.

### Technical Explanation

The Cluster Autoscaler monitors the Kubernetes cluster for pods that are pending scheduling due to insufficient resources (CPU, memory, etc.). When it detects such pods, it attempts to scale up the cluster by adding new nodes to satisfy the resource requirements of the pending pods. This functionality is susceptible to manipulation if:

*   **Resource Requests are Over-Provisioned:** Applications request significantly more resources than they actually need.
*   **Resource Limits are Absent or Too High:**  Applications are allowed to consume an unlimited amount of resources.
*   **The CA is not properly configured:** Misconfigured CA settings, such as overly aggressive scaling parameters, can amplify the impact of resource manipulation.
*   **The attacker can influence deployment definitions:** If an attacker can alter the resource requests/limits, they can directly control the scaling behavior.

The CA relies on the resource requests specified in pod deployments to determine the required capacity. By inflating these requests, an attacker can artificially increase the demand, forcing the CA to scale up even when the actual workload does not require it.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   A Kubernetes cluster with the Cluster Autoscaler enabled and configured.
*   Access to deploy or modify pod specifications within the cluster. The level of access influences the exploitation complexity.  Read-only access to deployments allows for observing the impact of changes made by others.
*   Understanding of Kubernetes resource requests and limits.
*   Cloud provider credentials or access to cloud provider console (for monitoring node creation and resource consumption).
*   `kubectl` configured to interact with the target cluster.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

**Phase 1: Validation (Observing and Monitoring)**

1.  **Check Cluster Autoscaler Status:**

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n kube-system $(kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep cluster-autoscaler | awk '{print $1}')
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command retrieves the logs of the Cluster Autoscaler pod.
    *   **Why:** To monitor the CA's decisions and identify its scaling behavior. This provides a baseline before attempting to manipulate the system.
    *   **Expected Output:** Logs showing the CA's actions, including scale-up and scale-down events, node group status, and reasons for scaling decisions. Look for lines related to "scale up" or "scale down" and identify which node groups are being affected.
    *   **Contribution:** Establishes a baseline to compare against later after modifications. Helps understand the existing scaling triggers.
    *   **Variation:** If logs are not readily available, check the CA's configuration for debugging level and adjust accordingly.

2.  **Identify a Target Deployment:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get deployments -n default
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** Lists deployments in the 'default' namespace. You can change the namespace if necessary.
    *   **Why:** To choose a deployment whose resource requests and limits you will manipulate. Ideally, choose a deployment with low actual resource utilization to maximize the impact of inflated requests.
    *   **Expected Output:** A table listing the deployments in the specified namespace, including their names, desired replicas, current replicas, and up-to-date replicas.
    *   **Contribution:** Provides a deployment name for subsequent manipulation.
    *   **Variation:**  Filter deployments by label or annotation to target specific applications.

3. **Observe Current Node Count:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
     * **Explanation:** Gets the current list of Kubernetes nodes.
     * **Why:** To establish a baseline node count before attempting to trigger scaling.
     * **Expected Output:** A list of the Kubernetes nodes including names, status, roles, ages, and versions.
     * **Contribution:**  Provides the starting point for determining if the scaling attack is working.

**Phase 2: Exploitation (Inflating Resource Requests)**

4.  **Patch the Target Deployment to Inflate Resource Requests:**

    ```bash
    kubectl patch deployment <deployment_name> -n <namespace> -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"<container_name>","resources":{"requests":{"cpu":"100","memory":"100Gi"}}}]}}}}'
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command patches the selected deployment to increase the CPU and memory requests of a container. Replace `<deployment_name>`, `<namespace>`, and `<container_name>` with the actual values. Setting both CPU and memory to high values increases the chances of triggering a scale-up.
    *   **Why:** To simulate a workload that requires significantly more resources than currently available, triggering the Cluster Autoscaler to provision new nodes.
    *   **Expected Output:**  `deployment.apps/<deployment_name> patched`
    *   **Contribution:** Modifies the deployment configuration to trigger autoscaling.
    *   **Variation:**  Use `kubectl edit deployment <deployment_name>` to directly edit the deployment manifest in a text editor for more complex changes. Also, experiment with different combinations of CPU and memory requests to find the optimal trigger.
    *   **Important:** Replace `<container_name>` with the actual name of the container within the deployment you are targeting. Get this using `kubectl describe deployment <deployment_name> -n <namespace>`.

5.  **Monitor Cluster Autoscaler Logs (Again):**

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n kube-system $(kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep cluster-autoscaler | awk '{print $1}')
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  Same as Step 1.  This time, we are monitoring the CA after making the changes.
    *   **Why:** To observe if the patch in the previous step caused the Cluster Autoscaler to initiate a scale-up operation.
    *   **Expected Output:** Logs showing the CA recognizing the pending pods with increased resource requests and initiating a scale-up operation. Look for lines indicating "Need to scale up" or "Scaling up node group". The logs should indicate the specific node group being scaled.
    *   **Contribution:** Confirms that the resource manipulation is affecting the CA's decision-making.

6.  **Monitor Node Creation in the Cloud Provider:**

    Log into your cloud provider's console (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and monitor the creation of new virtual machines (nodes) in the cluster's node pool.

    *   **Explanation:** Directly observe the scaling activity happening in the infrastructure layer.
    *   **Why:** To confirm that the CA is successfully provisioning new nodes in response to the manipulated resource requests.
    *   **Expected Output:** New virtual machines being launched and joining the Kubernetes cluster.  The speed of this will depend on your cloud provider and the autoscaling configurations.
    *   **Contribution:** Provides visual confirmation that the exploitation is working.

7.  **Check Node Count (Again):**

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

     * **Explanation:** Gets the current list of Kubernetes nodes, same as before
     * **Why:** To verify that the number of Kubernetes nodes has increased.
     * **Expected Output:** The list of Kubernetes nodes should now include new nodes.
     * **Contribution:**  Demonstrates that the attack is successfully scaling the cluster.

**Phase 3: Exploitation (Inflating Replica Counts)**

*This phase is performed after Phase 2 has successfully shown the ability to scale the cluster.*

8.  **Scale Up Deployment:**

    ```bash
    kubectl scale deployment <deployment_name> --replicas=<large_number> -n <namespace>
    ```
     * **Explanation:**  Scales up the deployment to a large number of replicas. Replace `<deployment_name>`, `<large_number>`, and `<namespace>` with the actual values. A value such as '100' for replicas can cause a massive scaleup.
     * **Why:** To create numerous pending pods each requesting large resources, pushing the autoscaler to extreme scaling.
     * **Expected Output:** `deployment.apps/<deployment_name> scaled`
     * **Contribution:** Combined with over-provisioned resource requests, this will aggressively trigger scaleup.

9.  **Repeat Steps 5-7 to Monitor Autoscaler and Node Creation:**

     * **Explanation:** This checks that the Autoscaler is being triggered and that new nodes are being created at an accelerated rate.
     * **Why:** To verify the scalability of the attack and potentially exhaust resources.

**Phase 4: Remediation**

10. **Scale Down or Delete the Deployment:**

    ```bash
    kubectl scale deployment <deployment_name> --replicas=0 -n <namespace>
    # OR
    kubectl delete deployment <deployment_name> -n <namespace>
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This reduces the number of replicas to 0 or deletes the deployment entirely, stopping the scaling activity.
    *   **Why:** To mitigate the immediate effects of the attack and prevent further resource consumption.
    *   **Expected Output:**  The deployment will be scaled down to zero replicas or deleted. Observe the Cluster Autoscaler scaling down the cluster.
    *   **Contribution:**  Ends the attack.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Implement Resource Quotas:** Use Kubernetes Resource Quotas to limit the total amount of resources that can be requested by deployments within a namespace.
*   **Enforce Resource Limits:** Require resource limits to be set for all containers in deployments.  This prevents applications from consuming unbounded resources.
*   **Right-Size Resource Requests:** Educate developers on the importance of accurately estimating resource requirements for their applications.
*   **Implement Pod Priority:** Use Pod Priority and Preemption to ensure that critical workloads are prioritized over less important ones during resource contention.
*   **Review Cluster Autoscaler Configuration:** Carefully review the Cluster Autoscaler configuration, including scaling parameters, to ensure they are appropriate for the cluster's workload. Consider implementing minimum and maximum node limits.
*   **Implement Network Policies:** Use Network Policies to restrict communication between different namespaces and prevent unauthorized deployments from influencing the autoscaling behavior of critical applications.
*   **Implement Admission Controllers:** Create a validating admission webhook to ensure every deployment has the required resource limits and requests set. It can also enforce maximum resource values.

**Conclusion:**

This documentation details how an attacker can manipulate the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to trigger excessive scaling, leading to resource exhaustion and potential denial of service. By understanding the vulnerabilities and implementing the remediation recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of this type of attack.
