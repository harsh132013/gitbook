# Kubernetes SSL/TLS Termination Bypass Vulnerability

## 1. Overview Section

**Attack Vector Description:**

SSL/TLS termination bypass occurs when an attacker can bypass the secure termination of TLS traffic, potentially gaining access to unencrypted data or manipulating requests intended to be secure. In Kubernetes, this often happens when misconfigured ingress controllers or service meshes expose internal services that should only be accessible via HTTPS, allowing attackers to communicate directly with backend services over HTTP. Attackers can also craft requests with forged headers that are then passed on to backend services, bypassing intended security measures.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive information transmitted over HTTP instead of HTTPS can be intercepted.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms intended to be enforced at the TLS termination point, attackers might gain unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Request Forgery:** Attackers can manipulate requests by injecting malicious headers, potentially leading to command injection or other vulnerabilities in the backend services.
*   **Service Disruption:** Resource exhaustion through unauthenticated or unauthorized access.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

*   **Critical:** If sensitive data is exposed, or if the bypass allows privilege escalation or remote code execution.
*   **High:** If the bypass compromises security controls and grants unauthorized access, even if sensitive data is not directly exposed.
*   **Medium:** If the bypass allows access to limited functionality with minimal impact.

**Technical Explanation:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:

1.  **Misconfiguration of Ingress Controllers:** Ingress controllers might be configured to accept both HTTP and HTTPS traffic, forwarding HTTP traffic directly to backend services without proper security checks.
2.  **Trusting User-Supplied Headers:** Backend services might blindly trust headers such as `X-Forwarded-Proto` without proper validation. This allows attackers to inject these headers and trick the application into thinking the request was originally HTTPS, bypassing security checks that are only triggered for HTTP requests.
3.  **Lack of Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Without mTLS, backend services cannot be sure of the identity of the caller, thus are more susceptible to forgery attacks.
4.  **Service Mesh Misconfigurations:** Improperly configured service meshes might not enforce TLS or authentication/authorization consistently across all services.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   Access to the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., through `kubectl` or other API access).
*   Network connectivity to the target service or ingress controller.
*   Knowledge of the cluster's service discovery mechanisms (e.g., DNS names of services).
*   Information about the ingress controller configuration or deployed services.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Validation**

1.  **Identify Target Services:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -n <namespace>
    ```

    Explanation: This command lists all services in a specified namespace. We need to identify potential targets that might be vulnerable.  The `-n <namespace>` flag is critical for narrowing the scope.
    Expected Output: A list of services with their names, types, and ports.  Look for services that might be accessible externally through an ingress.
    Why: Reconnaissance is the first step to identify potential attack targets.

2.  **Inspect Ingress Configuration (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    kubectl get ingress -n <namespace> -o yaml
    ```

    Explanation: This command retrieves the YAML definition of an ingress resource. This is crucial to understand how traffic is being routed and if HTTP traffic is allowed.
    Expected Output: A YAML file describing the ingress, including rules, hostnames, and backend services.  Look for entries that allow HTTP (port 80) traffic to be routed to a backend service. Also, check if the ingress controller uses annotations to configure TLS.
    Why: The ingress configuration is key to understanding how external traffic reaches internal services.

3.  **Check Service Endpoints:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get endpoints <service-name> -n <namespace>
    ```

    Explanation: This command retrieves the endpoints associated with a service, which indicates the Pods that are handling the traffic.
    Expected Output: A list of endpoints (IP addresses and ports) where the service can be reached.  This confirms the backend service's address.
    Why: Verifies the backend service's IP address and port for direct access attempts.

4.  **Attempt Direct HTTP Connection:**

    ```bash
    curl -v http://<service-ip>:<service-port>
    ```

    Explanation: This command attempts a direct HTTP connection to the service IP and port.
    Expected Output:
        *   If the service is directly accessible via HTTP, you'll receive a response (e.g., a 400 Bad Request, a 200 OK if the service is configured to serve something even via HTTP, or the application response).
        *   If the service is not directly accessible via HTTP, you'll likely see a connection refused error.  However, even if you get a connection refused, proceed to the next steps as the issue might be with the target not being configured correctly, not with inherent protections.
    Why: This is a direct check to see if the backend service accepts HTTP connections, bypassing any TLS termination.

5.  **Probe for `X-Forwarded-Proto` Vulnerability:**

    ```bash
    curl -v -H "X-Forwarded-Proto: http" https://<ingress-hostname>
    ```

    Explanation: This command sends an HTTPS request to the ingress hostname with the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header set to "http".
    Expected Output:
        * If the backend application incorrectly trusts the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header and performs HTTP-only actions (e.g., redirects to HTTP URLs), then the application is vulnerable. Look at the response headers and body for HTTP-based URLs or actions. A redirect to an HTTP URL is a clear indicator of the vulnerability. Also, if the application otherwise acts differently than if the header was missing, this could be indicative of an exploit.
    Why: Tests whether the backend application trusts the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header and makes decisions based on its value.

6. **Exploit HTTP-Only functionality or HTTP Redirects:**

If the application uses the X-Forwarded-Proto header to generate HTTP links or redirect to HTTP URLs, exploit this by intercepting responses or manipulating the X-Forwarded-Proto header in subsequent requests to force the application to use HTTP and leak sensitive data. For example, an HTTP redirect to `/login` could be intercepted and modified to point to a malicious server, enabling credential harvesting.

**Phase 2: Exploitation**

1. **Exploitation Scenario 1: Data Interception:**

    If the validation steps confirm that the application exposes sensitive data over HTTP due to a bypass, capture the traffic to intercept the data.  This is the core of the exploitation phase.

    ```bash
    tcpdump -i <interface> -s 0 -w capture.pcap port 80
    ```

    Explanation: This command captures all traffic on port 80 on the specified network interface (`<interface>`).  Replace `<interface>` with the correct interface (e.g., `eth0`, `any`).
    Expected Output: A `.pcap` file containing the captured network traffic.  Examine the `capture.pcap` file using Wireshark or similar tools to identify sensitive data transmitted over HTTP.
    Why: Captures unencrypted data being transmitted due to the TLS bypass.

2.  **Exploitation Scenario 2: Request Forgery via Header Manipulation:**

    If the `X-Forwarded-Proto` or similar headers are trusted, manipulate them to bypass security checks and potentially escalate privileges. This example simulates manipulating the `X-Authenticated-User` to impersonate another user.

    ```bash
    curl -v -H "X-Forwarded-Proto: https" -H "X-Authenticated-User: admin" https://<ingress-hostname>/admin-panel
    ```

    Explanation: Sends an HTTPS request with headers that attempt to impersonate an administrator user.
    Expected Output: If successful, the application might grant access to the `/admin-panel` resource, even without proper authentication. Check the server response for access to administrative functions or data.
    Why: Shows how header manipulation can lead to privilege escalation.

3.  **Exploitation Scenario 3: Exploiting HTTP Redirect Vulnerabilities**

    If the application uses the X-Forwarded-Proto header to generate redirect URLs, intercept the HTTP redirect and redirect it to a malicious server:

    1. Send a request to the application:

    ```bash
    curl -v -H "X-Forwarded-Proto: http" https://<ingress-hostname>/
    ```
    2. Observe the HTTP redirect in the response:

    ```
    < HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    < Location: http://<ingress-hostname>/login
    ```

    3. Use a tool like Burp Suite or a custom script to intercept the redirect response and modify the `Location` header to point to a malicious server. This server could then harvest credentials or redirect the user to a phishing page.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

1.  **Enforce HTTPS-Only Traffic:** Configure ingress controllers to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. This ensures that all communication is encrypted.
2.  **Validate `X-Forwarded-Proto` Header:** If the application relies on the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header, implement robust validation mechanisms to prevent header injection. Use a whitelist of trusted proxy IPs or strip the header entirely if not required. Better to use a standard header like `Forwarded` and configure the ingress controller correctly.
3.  **Implement Mutual TLS (mTLS):** Use mTLS to ensure that both the client and the server are authenticated before any data is exchanged.
4.  **Secure Service Mesh Configuration:** If using a service mesh, enforce TLS and authentication/authorization policies consistently across all services.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address vulnerabilities.
6.  **Ingress Controller Security:** Ensure ingress controllers are up-to-date with the latest security patches and best practices. Restrict ingress controller access to internal networks only. Consider using a dedicated ingress controller for external traffic.
7.  **Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege when configuring network policies and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
8.  **Header Stripping:** If `X-Forwarded-Proto` is not needed, configure the ingress controller to strip it.
