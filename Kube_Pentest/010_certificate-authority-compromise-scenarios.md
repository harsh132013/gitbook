# Kubernetes Certificate Authority (CA) Compromise

## 1. Overview Section

### Attack Vector Description

A compromised Kubernetes Certificate Authority (CA) poses a severe threat to the security of the entire cluster. An attacker with control of the CA can forge certificates for any user, service account, or component within the cluster. This enables complete control over the cluster, allowing them to impersonate administrators, access sensitive data, and deploy malicious workloads.

The attack involves gaining access to the `ca.crt` and `ca.key` files used by the Kubernetes control plane. Once these files are obtained, the attacker can use them to sign arbitrary Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), effectively creating valid certificates for any purpose within the cluster.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

The consequences of a CA compromise are catastrophic:

*   **Complete Cluster Takeover:** The attacker can impersonate cluster administrators, granting them full control over the Kubernetes API server and all cluster resources.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Access to all secrets, configuration maps, and other sensitive data within the cluster, allowing for data exfiltration.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Creation of certificates for service accounts with high privileges, facilitating privilege escalation.
*   **Denial of Service:** Revocation of valid certificates, disrupting cluster services and leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Malware Deployment:** Deployment of malicious pods and containers, potentially compromising applications and infrastructure outside the cluster.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Use of compromised service accounts to pivot to other systems and networks connected to the cluster.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical**

### Technical Explanation

Kubernetes relies on certificates for authentication and authorization between components. The CA is the root of trust for these certificates. When a component (e.g., kubelet, kube-proxy, kube-apiserver) needs to communicate with another component, it presents a certificate signed by the CA. The receiving component verifies the certificate against the CA's public key (`ca.crt`).

If the attacker obtains the CA's private key (`ca.key`), they can generate valid certificates that the cluster will trust. This bypasses all authentication and authorization mechanisms, granting the attacker complete control.

The vulnerability exists because the `ca.crt` and `ca.key` files are often stored on the control plane nodes. If these nodes are compromised through other vulnerabilities (e.g., weak SSH credentials, misconfigured firewalls, software vulnerabilities), the attacker can access these critical files. Improper access controls on these files can also lead to compromise.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Access to a control plane node:** The attacker must have some form of access (e.g., SSH access, container escape) to at least one of the control plane nodes.
*   **Permissions to read the CA key file:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges on the control plane node to read the `ca.crt` and `ca.key` files. These files are typically located in `/etc/kubernetes/pki/`.
*   **Tools:** The attacker needs tools like `openssl` and `kubectl` to create CSRs and interact with the Kubernetes API.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

### Phase 1: Validation (Identifying the vulnerability and CA location)

1.  **Gain Access to a Control Plane Node:**  (Assuming SSH access in this example)

    ```bash
    ssh <user>@<control_plane_node_ip>
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  Establish a secure shell connection to one of the Kubernetes control plane nodes. This is the initial foothold needed to access sensitive files.
    *   **Expected Output:**  A shell prompt on the control plane node.
    *   **Why:**  Essential first step to begin interacting with the control plane.
    *   **Variation:** If SSH isn't available, explore container escape techniques if access is gained through a compromised pod running on the control plane.

2.  **Identify CA Certificate and Key Locations:**

    ```bash
    find / -name ca.crt 2>/dev/null
    find / -name ca.key 2>/dev/null
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** Search the file system for files named `ca.crt` and `ca.key`. The `2>/dev/null` redirects error messages to prevent clutter.
    *   **Expected Output:**  Paths to the `ca.crt` and `ca.key` files, typically `/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt` and `/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key`.
    *   **Why:**  To locate the CA certificate and private key, which are crucial for exploiting the vulnerability.
    *   **Variation:**  Inspect the kube-apiserver manifest file (usually in `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`) to determine the paths to the CA files specified in the `--client-ca-file` and `--tls-private-key-file` arguments.

3.  **Verify Permissions on CA Key:**

    ```bash
    ls -l /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  List the file permissions of the `ca.key` file.
    *   **Expected Output:**  The file permissions, e.g., `-rw-------`.  If the key is world-readable (unlikely but possible) or accessible to the current user, the vulnerability is easier to exploit.
    *   **Why:**  To confirm the ability to read the key file.  If permissions are too restrictive, further privilege escalation might be required before exploitation.
    *   **Variation:** Use `sudo` to read the file if necessary after escalating privileges.

4.  **Read the CA Certificate (Public Key):**

    ```bash
    cat /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  Display the contents of the `ca.crt` file. This is the public key of the CA.
    *   **Expected Output:**  The contents of the certificate in PEM format.
    *   **Why:**  To confirm the presence of the certificate and potentially extract information such as the issuer. This public key is required for the exploitation.

5.  **Attempt to Read the CA Key (Private Key):**

    ```bash
    cat /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  Attempt to display the contents of the `ca.key` file.
    *   **Expected Output:**  If successful (i.e., the user has sufficient permissions), the contents of the key file in PEM format. If unsuccessful, a "Permission denied" error.
    *   **Why:** To confirm the successful retrieval of the private key, a critical step for CA compromise.

    *   **If Permission Denied:** Attempt privilege escalation methods, such as exploiting known vulnerabilities on the node, weak sudo configurations, or leveraging service accounts if in a compromised container on the control plane.

### Phase 2: Exploitation (Creating a malicious certificate and impersonating a user)

1.  **Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for an Administrator User:** (Assuming you have the `ca.key` and `ca.crt` available locally after transferring from the compromised control plane node)

    ```bash
    openssl req -new -key ca.key -out admin.csr -subj "/CN=system:admin"
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  Generates a new CSR for a user named `system:admin`, which has cluster-admin privileges in most Kubernetes setups. Replace `ca.key` with the actual path to the CA key file.
    *   **Expected Output:** The `admin.csr` file will be created.
    *   **Why:** To request a certificate that grants administrator privileges.
    *   **Variation:** You could choose a different user or group to impersonate based on the target access level.

2.  **Sign the CSR using the CA Private Key:**

    ```bash
    openssl x509 -req -in admin.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out admin.crt -days 365
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  Signs the CSR with the CA's private key (`ca.key`) and certificate (`ca.crt`). This creates a valid certificate (`admin.crt`) that the Kubernetes API server will trust. `-CAcreateserial` creates a serial file needed for signing.
    *   **Expected Output:**  The `admin.crt` file will be created.
    *   **Why:**  Creates a trusted certificate that can be used to authenticate as the administrator user. The certificate is valid for 365 days.

3.  **Configure `kubectl` to use the newly created certificate and key:**

    ```bash
    kubectl config set-credentials hacked-admin --client-certificate=admin.crt --client-key=ca.key --embed-certs=true
    kubectl config set-context hacked-admin-context --cluster=<cluster_name> --user=hacked-admin
    kubectl config use-context hacked-admin-context
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** Configures `kubectl` to use the `admin.crt` and `ca.key` files for authentication, impersonating the `system:admin` user.  Replace `<cluster_name>` with the name of your Kubernetes cluster. You can find the cluster name with `kubectl config view`. The `--embed-certs=true` option stores the certificate in the `kubectl` configuration file.
    *   **Expected Output:**  The `kubectl` configuration will be updated.
    *   **Why:** Allows you to interact with the Kubernetes API server using the forged administrator credentials.

4.  **Verify Administrator Access:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  Retrieves a list of all pods across all namespaces. This requires cluster-admin privileges.
    *   **Expected Output:**  A list of all pods in all namespaces. If the command is successful, it confirms that you have successfully impersonated an administrator user. If it fails, double-check the certificate generation and `kubectl` configuration steps.
    *   **Why:** Confirms successful exploitation by demonstrating access to resources requiring high privileges.

5.  **(Optional) Deploy a Malicious Pod:**

    ```bash
    kubectl run malicious-pod --image=alpine/curl --restart=Never --command -- sh -c "while true; do curl http://internal-service; sleep 1; done"
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** Deploys a simple pod that continuously makes requests to an internal service.  This is a demonstration of the ability to deploy arbitrary workloads to the cluster.
    *   **Expected Output:** The `malicious-pod` will be created and start running.
    *   **Why:** To demonstrate the potential for deploying malicious payloads.

### Remediation Recommendations

1.  **Secure the CA Key:** Store the `ca.key` file securely, preferably using a Hardware Security Module (HSM).
2.  **Restrict Access to Control Plane Nodes:** Implement strong access controls and monitoring on control plane nodes.  Limit SSH access to only authorized personnel and enforce multi-factor authentication.
3.  **Rotate Certificates Regularly:**  Rotate the CA certificate and key periodically to reduce the impact of a potential compromise.
4.  **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and security information and event management (SIEM) systems to monitor for suspicious activity on control plane nodes, such as unauthorized access attempts or file modifications.
5.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Enforce the principle of least privilege by granting users and service accounts only the necessary permissions.  Avoid granting cluster-admin privileges unnecessarily.
6.  **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits of the Kubernetes cluster to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
7.  **Network Segmentation:** Segregate the control plane network from other networks to limit the impact of a compromise.
8.  **Secret Management:** Store sensitive data, such as API keys and passwords, in Kubernetes secrets. Securely manage and rotate these secrets regularly.
9. **Consider using a managed Kubernetes service:** Services such as GKE, EKS, and AKS handle the management of the control plane, including CA management. This significantly reduces the risk of CA compromise.
