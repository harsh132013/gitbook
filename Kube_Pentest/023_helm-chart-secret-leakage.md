# Helm Chart Secret Leakage Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

This document details the vulnerability of secret leakage within Helm charts. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information, potentially compromising the entire Kubernetes cluster and applications running within it.

**Attack Vector Description:**

Helm charts are packages containing pre-configured Kubernetes resources. If a chart improperly stores secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys, certificates) in plain text within the chart itself or its associated templates (YAML files), an attacker can retrieve these secrets. This leakage often occurs when developers inadvertently commit secrets directly into the chart repository or when secrets are not properly handled during chart templating. An attacker typically gains access to the Helm chart repository (public or private) or the chart files themselves.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Data Breach:** Compromised secrets can lead to unauthorized access to databases, APIs, and other services.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Stolen credentials might grant access to higher-privilege accounts and resources within the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Cluster Takeover:** Access to cluster-level secrets, such as service account tokens or cluster admin credentials, can lead to complete cluster compromise.
*   **Application Downtime:** Attackers might use stolen secrets to disrupt or disable applications.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A security breach can significantly damage an organization's reputation.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

**Critical/High** - The severity depends on the value of the leaked secrets. Leaking cluster-level secrets is critical; leaking application-specific secrets is high.

**Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists:**

The vulnerability exists due to:

*   **Poor Secret Management Practices:** Developers directly embedding secrets into Helm chart files instead of using Kubernetes Secrets or external secret management tools.
*   **Lack of Awareness:** Insufficient understanding of secure secret handling practices within the Helm ecosystem.
*   **Insecure Storage:** Storing Helm charts in publicly accessible repositories without proper security controls.
*   **Templating Errors:** Incorrect use of Helm templating, which might inadvertently expose secrets.
*   **Configuration Errors:** Improper configuration of CI/CD pipelines or other tools used to manage Helm charts.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   Access to the Helm chart repository (e.g., Git repository, artifact repository).
*   Alternatively, access to a system where the Helm chart files are stored.
*   Knowledge of Helm and Kubernetes concepts.
*   Ability to use command-line tools such as `kubectl`, `helm`, `grep`, and `base64`.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This section outlines the steps to validate and exploit the Helm chart secret leakage vulnerability.

**Phase 1: Validation - Identifying the Vulnerability**

**Step 1: Clone the Helm Chart Repository (if applicable)**

```bash
git clone <helm_chart_repository_url>
cd <helm_chart_repository_directory>
```

**Explanation:** If the Helm chart repository is hosted on a Git platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), clone the repository to your local machine.
**Why:** This provides access to the chart's source code, including potentially sensitive information.
**Expected Output:** Successful cloning of the repository.
**Contribution:** Provides the raw chart files for analysis.
**Alternative Approaches:** If direct Git access is not available, obtain the Helm chart as a `.tgz` archive.

**Step 2: Inspect the `Chart.yaml` file.**

```bash
cat Chart.yaml
```

**Explanation:** This command displays the contents of the `Chart.yaml` file, which provides metadata about the chart, including its name, version, and description.
**Why:** While it unlikely to contain secrets, it provides context about the chart.
**Expected Output:** The contents of the `Chart.yaml` file.
**Contribution:** Provides context for the chart being examined.

**Step 3: Search for Secrets in Values.yaml File.**

```bash
grep -iE "password|secret|apikey|token|key|certificate|auth" values.yaml
```

**Explanation:** This command searches the `values.yaml` file for keywords commonly associated with secrets. The `-i` flag makes the search case-insensitive, and the `-E` flag enables extended regular expressions.
**Why:** The `values.yaml` file often contains default values used by the chart. If secrets are stored here in plain text, they are immediately vulnerable.
**Expected Output:** Any lines in the `values.yaml` file that contain the specified keywords. Look for values that look like passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information.
**Contribution:** Identifies potential secret leakage in default configuration values.
**Potential Variations:** Expand the keyword list based on the specific application or chart being analyzed.

**Step 4: Inspect Template Files for Hardcoded Secrets.**

```bash
find templates/ -name "*.yaml" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -iE "password|secret|apikey|token|key|certificate|auth"
```

**Explanation:** This command searches all YAML files within the `templates/` directory for the same keywords used in the previous step.  `find ... -print0` and `xargs -0` are used to handle filenames with spaces or special characters.
**Why:** Template files define the Kubernetes resources that will be deployed. Hardcoded secrets in these files are a significant vulnerability.
**Expected Output:** Any lines in the template files that contain the specified keywords. Examine the surrounding code to determine if the matched text is a hardcoded secret.
**Contribution:** Identifies direct hardcoded secrets in resource definitions.
**Potential Variations:** You might need to adjust the path `templates/` depending on the chart's structure.

**Step 5: Look for Improper Use of `base64` Encoding.**

```bash
find templates/ -name "*.yaml" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -i "base64"
```

**Explanation:** This command searches for instances of `base64` within the template files.
**Why:** While `base64` encoding is *not* encryption, developers sometimes mistakenly use it, thinking it provides adequate security. Plain `base64` encoding is easily reversible and effectively reveals the underlying secret.
**Expected Output:** Any lines in the template files that contain the string "base64".  Inspect the surrounding code to see if it's being used to "encode" a sensitive value.  A tell-tale sign is `echo <secret> | base64` or similar.
**Contribution:** Identifies misuse of `base64` encoding as a weak form of "security".

**Step 6: Decode Base64 Encoded Secrets (If Found).**

```bash
echo "<base64_encoded_secret>" | base64 --decode
```

**Explanation:** This command decodes a base64 encoded string using the `base64` utility. Replace `<base64_encoded_secret>` with the actual base64 encoded value found in the previous step.
**Why:**  Reveals the plaintext secret that was "encoded" using base64.
**Expected Output:** The plaintext secret.
**Contribution:** Confirms that a base64 encoded value is indeed a secret and reveals its value.

**Step 7: Check for Secrets in Helper Templates (Functions).**

```bash
find templates/ -name "_*.tpl" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -iE "password|secret|apikey|token|key|certificate|auth"
```

**Explanation:** Helm charts often use helper templates (files named starting with an underscore) to define reusable functions.  This command searches these files for potential secrets.
**Why:** Secrets might be unintentionally exposed through helper functions if not properly handled.
**Expected Output:** Lines containing secrets within the helper template files.
**Contribution:** Identifies secrets leaking through helper template functions.

**Step 8: Scan for hardcoded passwords in deployment files.**
```bash
find templates/ -name "*.yaml" -print0 | xargs -0 grep -iE "username:|user:|password:"
```

**Explanation:** Searches for common username/password configurations directly in the deployment configuration.
**Why:** These configurations are often included, hardcoded into the deployment files.
**Expected Output:** Lines containing a username, user, or password inside a deployment configuration yaml file.
**Contribution:** Finds the hardcoded password which can be used to validate access to a deployed application.

**Phase 2: Exploitation - Utilizing Leaked Secrets**

The following steps assume that you have successfully identified leaked secrets within the Helm chart.

**Step 1: Deploy the Helm Chart (if not already deployed).**

If the chart is not already deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, deploy it:

```bash
helm install <release_name> ./<chart_directory>
```

**Explanation:**  This command deploys the Helm chart to a Kubernetes cluster, creating the resources defined in the templates.  Replace `<release_name>` with a name for the release and `<chart_directory>` with the path to the chart directory.
**Why:**  This step might be necessary to observe the behavior of the application and confirm that the leaked secrets are being used. In many cases, you will be targeting a pre-existing, already-deployed instance.
**Expected Output:**  Successful deployment of the Helm chart.
**Contribution:** Creates the environment where the exploited secrets are used.

**Step 2: Access the Service using the Leaked Credentials (Example).**

This step depends on the type of secret that was leaked and the application that uses it.  The following is an example assuming a database password was leaked.

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/<database_service_name> 5432:5432
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U <database_user> -W
```

**Explanation:**

*   `kubectl port-forward`:  Forwards port 5432 (the standard PostgreSQL port) from the database service to your local machine. Replace `<database_service_name>` with the actual name of the database service in your cluster.
*   `psql`:  Connects to the PostgreSQL database using the forwarded port. Replace `<database_user>` with the username.  You will be prompted for the password, which is the leaked database password.
**Why:**  This allows you to verify that the leaked password grants access to the database.
**Expected Output:**  Successful connection to the PostgreSQL database after providing the leaked password.
**Contribution:**  Demonstrates the real-world impact of the leaked secret.

**Step 3: Utilize API Keys (Example).**

If an API key was leaked, use it to make API requests and verify unauthorized access. For example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <leaked_api_key>" <api_endpoint>
```

**Explanation:**  This command sends an API request to `<api_endpoint>` with the leaked API key in the `Authorization` header. Replace `<leaked_api_key>` with the leaked API key and `<api_endpoint>` with the API endpoint you want to access.
**Why:**  This verifies that the leaked API key grants unauthorized access to the API.
**Expected Output:**  A successful API response, indicating that the API key is valid and grants access.
**Contribution:**  Demonstrates unauthorized API access using the leaked key.

**Phase 3: Reporting and Remediation**

Once you've validated the vulnerability, report it and recommend the following remediation steps:

*   **Use Kubernetes Secrets:** Store sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys, in Kubernetes Secrets rather than hardcoding them in Helm chart files.
*   **External Secret Management:**  Integrate with external secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud Secret Manager.
*   **Secret Scanning in CI/CD:** Implement secret scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to prevent accidental commits of secrets.
*   **Secure Chart Repositories:** Secure access to Helm chart repositories using appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of Helm charts and deployments.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to service accounts and other entities.
*   **Rotate Secrets:** Rotate secrets regularly to minimize the impact of a potential compromise.
*   **Proper Templating:** Ensure that Helm templates are properly designed to avoid exposing secrets.  Avoid constructs like `echo <secret> | base64`.
*   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest, both within the Kubernetes cluster and in any external storage systems.
