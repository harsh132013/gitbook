# Kubernetes Process Namespace Sharing Exploitation

## 1. Overview Section

**Attack Vector Description:**

This vulnerability exploits process namespace sharing within Kubernetes Pods to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or execute arbitrary commands within the context of other containers within the same Pod. By gaining access to a container that shares a process namespace with other containers, an attacker can enumerate processes running in those other containers, potentially identify sensitive processes (e.g., a process holding secrets or credentials), and even inject code or signals into those processes. This can lead to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can escalate privileges by injecting code into a higher-privileged process.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can read sensitive data from processes within the shared namespace, such as secrets, API keys, or confidential data.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker can disrupt or terminate processes, leading to application downtime.
*   **Lateral Movement:** In some cases, this vulnerability can facilitate lateral movement to other resources within the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Container Breakout:** Depending on the pod's configuration and the underlying container runtime, further exploitation can potentially lead to a container breakout.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

*   **Critical:** If successful, this vulnerability allows an attacker to compromise the entire Pod, potentially leading to cluster-wide compromise.

**Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists:**

Kubernetes allows containers within a Pod to share certain namespaces, including the process namespace.  This is often used to facilitate inter-container communication or to allow a sidecar container to monitor or assist the main application container.  However, sharing the process namespace means that one container can "see" and interact with the processes running in other containers.  If not properly secured, this shared visibility can be exploited. The vulnerability stems from the fact that process IDs are unique within the shared process namespace.  An attacker in one container can use standard process management tools (e.g., `kill`, `ptrace`, `/proc`) to interact with processes in other containers as if they were local to their own container.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   **Process Namespace Sharing:** At least two containers within a Kubernetes Pod must be configured to share the process namespace (`shareProcessNamespace: true` in the Pod specification).
*   **Initial Container Access:** The attacker needs initial access to one of the containers within the Pod, potentially through a separate vulnerability (e.g., a vulnerable application running in the container, default credentials, or misconfigured network policies).
*   **Privileged Container (Optional, but increases impact):** If one of the containers sharing the process namespace has elevated privileges (e.g., running as root), the potential impact of the vulnerability is significantly higher.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

This section outlines how to validate and exploit process namespace sharing within a Kubernetes Pod.

**Phase 1: Validation - Confirming Process Namespace Sharing**

1.  **Gain Access to a Target Container:**

    We'll assume we've already gained access to a container in the target Pod (e.g., via web application vulnerability).  This may involve using `kubectl exec` if we have cluster admin rights, or exploiting a vulnerable application within the target pod.  For this example, let's assume the pod name is `shared-process-pod` and the container name is `attacker-container`.

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it shared-process-pod -c attacker-container -- bash
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command executes a bash shell within the `attacker-container` of the `shared-process-pod` pod.
    *   **Why:** To gain a shell inside the container we want to use to probe.
    *   **Expected Output:** A shell prompt within the container (e.g., `root@attacker-container:/#`).
    *   **Contribution:** Allows us to run commands within the container to validate and exploit the vulnerability.

2.  **Identify the Target Container ID:**

    Inside the `attacker-container`, find its container ID.  This is typically found in `/proc/self/cgroup`.

    ```bash
    cat /proc/self/cgroup
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command reads the `/proc/self/cgroup` file, which contains cgroup information for the current process.
    *   **Why:** To determine the container ID, which we need to filter processes by in later steps.
    *   **Expected Output:**  A list of cgroup paths.  Look for a path that looks like `/kubepods/burstable/pod<pod-uid>/<container-id>`, where `<container-id>` is the value we need.  For example: `0::/kubepods/burstable/pod12345-6789-0abc-def0-1234567890ab/abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567890`  The container ID would be `abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567890`.
    *   **Contribution:** Provides the container ID necessary to isolate processes belonging to the target container.

3.  **List Processes within the Container:**

    Use the `ps` command to list processes running within the current container and identify the PID of the `attacker-container`'s main process.

    ```bash
    ps aux
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command lists all processes with detailed information.
    *   **Why:** To identify the process running inside our container and the PIDs.
    *   **Expected Output:** A table listing all processes, their PIDs, users, memory usage, etc.  Note the PID of the main process running in `attacker-container` (e.g., the `bash` process we just started).
    *   **Contribution:** Establishes a baseline of what processes are running inside the initial container.

4.  **Check for Other Containers in the Pod:**

    Now, check if we can see processes from other containers in the pod.  Use `ps aux` again, but this time, filter the results.  We know the container ID of *our* container.  We want to see *other* processes.

    ```bash
    ps aux | grep -v "abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567890"
    ```
    (Replace `abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567890` with the container ID from step 2.)

    *   **Explanation:**  This command lists all processes, but filters out any lines containing the container ID of *our* container.
    *   **Why:** This allows us to see all processes outside of the attacker-container but within the same pod if process namespace sharing is enabled.
    *   **Expected Output:** If process namespace sharing is enabled, you'll see processes from other containers in the same pod.  If process namespace sharing *isn't* enabled, you'll likely only see processes related to the attacker container and system processes.
    *   **Contribution:** Confirms whether process namespace sharing is enabled. **If you do NOT see processes from other containers, this exploit will fail.  Stop here and report that process namespace sharing is disabled.**

**Phase 2: Exploitation - Injecting a Signal into a Target Process**

Assuming process namespace sharing has been validated, we can proceed with exploitation. Let's assume there's another container named `target-container` in the same Pod running a process named `vulnerable-service` with PID `123`. The purpose of this example is to send a signal to `vulnerable-service` in the target container, potentially causing it to crash or trigger a specific behavior.

1.  **Send a Signal to a Process in Another Container:**

    Use the `kill` command to send a `SIGTERM` signal to the `vulnerable-service` process.

    ```bash
    kill -TERM 123
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  This command sends the `SIGTERM` signal (termination signal) to the process with PID `123`.
    *   **Why:** To attempt to terminate a process in another container, demonstrating control over its execution.
    *   **Expected Output:** If successful, the `vulnerable-service` process will likely terminate or restart. Check the logs of the `target-container` to confirm the process was affected. You might see a message like "Process terminated by signal SIGTERM" or similar. If the service is set to restart, it may start up again soon after. If `kill` returns an error ("Operation not permitted"), it indicates insufficient privileges or incorrect PID. Double-check the PID from the previous step and the user context of the container (are you root?).
    *   **Contribution:**  Demonstrates the ability to influence processes in other containers within the same Pod, confirming successful exploitation of process namespace sharing.

2. **Alternative: Ptrace (Requires CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability)**

   If the container has `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` capability, a much more powerful attack is possible. Ptrace allows attaching to another process and controlling its execution and memory.  Here's a simple example demonstrating reading memory.  This is a significantly more impactful attack.

   First, install `gdb` inside the attacker container if it's not already present.

   ```bash
   apt update && apt install -y gdb
   ```

   Then, use `gdb` to attach to the target process (PID 123).

   ```bash
   gdb -p 123
   ```

   Once `gdb` is attached, you can examine the process's memory:

   ```gdb
   (gdb) info proc mappings
   ```

   *   **Explanation:** `gdb -p 123` attaches `gdb` to process ID 123.  `info proc mappings` in `gdb` shows the process's memory map.
   *   **Why:** To demonstrate the ability to not just kill, but introspect the target process, a significantly more severe exploit.
   *   **Expected Output:**  `gdb` attaches to the process.  `info proc mappings` shows the memory layout.  If the attacker has `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, this will succeed.  If not, it will fail with a permission error.
   *   **Contribution:** Demonstrates complete control over the target process's memory and execution, which can lead to arbitrarily complex exploits such as code injection or data extraction.
   *   **Note:** This requires significantly more expertise to exploit fully, but even this simple memory mapping is a significant finding.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Avoid Process Namespace Sharing:** The most effective mitigation is to avoid sharing the process namespace unless absolutely necessary. If process namespace sharing is required, carefully consider the security implications and implement compensating controls.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that containers are running with the least privileges necessary. Avoid running containers as root whenever possible.
*   **Network Policies:** Implement network policies to restrict network traffic between containers and limit the potential impact of a compromised container.
*   **Pod Security Policies (Deprecated):** Consider using Pod Security Admission or similar mechanisms to enforce security policies on Pods and prevent the creation of Pods with insecure configurations (e.g., allowing process namespace sharing when not required). Ensure you're aware that PSPs are deprecated and are replaced by Pod Security Admission.
*   **Runtime Security:** Employ runtime security tools (e.g., Falco, Aqua Security, Sysdig Secure) to monitor container behavior and detect suspicious activities, such as attempts to access or manipulate processes in other containers.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of Kubernetes configurations and deployments to identify potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
*   **Update Kubernetes:** Keep your Kubernetes version up to date. Older versions are more likely to have known vulnerabilities.
