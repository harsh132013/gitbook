# Kubernetes Secrets Mounted as Environment Variables: Vulnerability Documentation

## 1. Overview

This document details the vulnerability of Kubernetes secrets being mounted as environment variables within containers. This configuration can inadvertently expose sensitive information, leading to significant security risks.

### Attack Vector Description

An attacker who gains access to a pod, either through a vulnerability in the application running within the pod or by exploiting cluster misconfigurations, can easily access the environment variables. If sensitive data, such as API keys, passwords, or certificates, are stored as environment variables via Kubernetes secrets, the attacker can retrieve this information and use it for malicious purposes. This is a particularly dangerous attack vector because environment variables are easily accessible within a container's context.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

*   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data leading to unauthorized access to systems and data.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Credentials exposed as environment variables can be used to access other services or resources within the cluster or even external systems.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Exposed credentials could grant higher privileges than the compromised container initially possessed.
*   **Denial of Service:** API keys could be used to exhaust resources or disrupt services.
*   **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can lead to significant reputational damage for the organization.

### Risk Level Assessment

**High**

The risk is considered high because it is relatively easy for an attacker to access environment variables once they have compromised a pod. The potential impact of exposing sensitive information is also significant.

### Technical Explanation

Kubernetes secrets are intended to be a secure way to store and manage sensitive information. While they offer a degree of protection at rest and in transit within the Kubernetes API server, exposing them as environment variables within a container bypasses many of those protections. The container runtime makes the environment variables readily available to any process running within the container.  This makes retrieval trivial for an attacker with compromised access to the pod.  Secrets should be explicitly handled within the application and not left exposed in such a way.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   A Kubernetes cluster with pods running.
*   Kubernetes secrets exist.
*   Pods are configured to mount secrets as environment variables (via `envFrom` or individual `env` entries).
*   The attacker has gained access to a pod, typically via:
    *   Exploiting a vulnerability in the application running in the pod.
    *   Compromising the node where the pod is running.
    *   Exploiting Kubernetes RBAC misconfigurations.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

The following steps illustrate how to validate and exploit this vulnerability:

**1. Gain Access to a Pod:**

This section assumes the attacker has already gained access to a pod. This access can be obtained in various ways, such as a reverse shell from a vulnerable web application, or a misconfigured RBAC allowing direct access. We'll simulate being inside a compromised pod for the remaining steps.

**2. Validate the Vulnerability: List Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Executing a shell inside the compromised pod.  Replace <pod_name> and <namespace>
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n <namespace> -- bash
```

*   **Explanation:** This command connects to a bash shell inside the targeted pod.  Replace `<pod_name>` with the name of the pod you believe is vulnerable and `<namespace>` with the namespace the pod resides in.
*   **Why:** We need to be inside the container's environment to examine the available environment variables.
*   **Expected Output:** A bash shell prompt, indicating successful connection to the pod.

```bash
# List all environment variables
env
```

*   **Explanation:** This command lists all environment variables defined within the container.
*   **Why:** This will allow us to confirm the existence of secrets exposed as environment variables.
*   **Expected Output:** A long list of environment variables.  Look for variables that seem like secrets (e.g., `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `API_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`). If secret values are directly set as environment variables, they will be visible here.
*   **Alternative Approaches:**
    *   `printenv`:  Alternative command to print environment variables.
    *   `cat /proc/1/environ`: Another way to access environment variables, although the output is less readable.

**3. Exploit the Vulnerability: Extract the Secret Value(s)**

If you see environment variables that contain sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys), you have successfully validated the vulnerability.  Now, you can extract and use these values.

```bash
# Extract the value of a specific environment variable.  Replace <VARIABLE_NAME> with the name of the exposed secret.
echo $DATABASE_PASSWORD
```

*   **Explanation:** This command prints the value of a specific environment variable to the console.
*   **Why:** To retrieve the actual secret value.
*   **Expected Output:** The actual value of the `DATABASE_PASSWORD` (or whatever `VARIABLE_NAME` you use) environment variable will be displayed. For example, `secret123`.
*   **Variation:**
    *   `printf "%s\n" "$DATABASE_PASSWORD"`:  A safer way to print variables to avoid potential issues with special characters.

**4. Demonstrate Impact (Example: Accessing Database):**

This step assumes you have identified a database password as an environment variable. This is a demonstration; adapt the following command to match your discovered exposed secrets.

```bash
# Attempt to connect to the database using the extracted credentials.  Replace <DATABASE_USER>, <DATABASE_PASSWORD>, and <DATABASE_HOST> with the actual values.
mysql -u <DATABASE_USER> -p"<DATABASE_PASSWORD>" -h <DATABASE_HOST>
```

*   **Explanation:** This command attempts to connect to a MySQL database using the credentials retrieved from the environment variables.  You need to replace placeholders with the actual values extracted in the previous steps.
*   **Why:** Demonstrates the real-world impact of the vulnerability. Successful database access proves the risk of credential exposure.
*   **Expected Output:** If the credentials are valid, the command will connect to the MySQL database and display the MySQL prompt (`mysql>`).  If the credentials are incorrect, you will receive an error message.

**5. Cleanup (Remove Sensitive Information from History):**

```bash
# Clear the bash history to prevent sensitive information from being stored.
history -c
exit
```

*   **Explanation:**  `history -c` clears the bash history for the current session, and `exit` closes the shell connection.
*   **Why:** Prevents residual sensitive information from remaining on the compromised system (or in the history).
*   **Expected Output:** Cleared history, connection terminated

## Remediation Recommendations

*   **Use Kubernetes Secrets Correctly:**  Secrets are designed for storing sensitive data.
*   **Avoid Mounting Secrets as Environment Variables:**  Favor mounting secrets as files.
*   **Configure Secrets as Files:** Mount secrets as files into a designated directory within the container's filesystem.  The application can then read the secret values from these files.
    *   **Example Pod Definition:**

        ```yaml
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: my-pod
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: my-container
              image: busybox
              command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 3600"]
              volumeMounts:
                - name: my-secret-volume
                  mountPath: /etc/secrets # Mount point inside the container
                  readOnly: true
          volumes:
            - name: my-secret-volume
              secret:
                secretName: my-secret # Name of the Kubernetes Secret
        ```
*   **Use a Secret Management Solution:** Consider using a more robust secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or GCP Secret Manager. These solutions provide advanced features such as encryption at rest, access control, audit logging, and secret rotation.
*   **Implement Least Privilege:**  Ensure that containers only have the necessary permissions to access resources.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of your Kubernetes cluster to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Rotate Secrets Regularly:** Implement a process for rotating secrets on a regular basis to minimize the impact of a potential compromise.
*   **Static Code Analysis:** Use static code analysis tools to identify hardcoded secrets or insecure handling of secrets within application code.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Perform DAST to identify potential vulnerabilities in running applications, including those related to secret management.
*   **Use a Runtime Security Solution:** Implement a runtime security solution that can detect and prevent malicious activity within containers. This can include detecting suspicious access to environment variables or file system locations where secrets are stored.
