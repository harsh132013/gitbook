# Managed Kubernetes Service Vulnerabilities

## 1. Overview

This document outlines common vulnerabilities found in managed Kubernetes services (e.g., AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE), focusing on misconfigurations and weaknesses that allow for unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration.  We'll examine scenarios where attackers can leverage exposed endpoints, weak identity and access management (IAM), and other misconfigurations to compromise the cluster.

### Attack Vector Description

Attackers can exploit managed Kubernetes service vulnerabilities through various avenues:

*   **Exposed Kubernetes API Server:** Directly accessing the API server without proper authentication and authorization controls.
*   **Weak IAM Roles/Permissions:** Misconfigured IAM roles granting excessive privileges to nodes, pods, or service accounts.
*   **Publicly Accessible Kubernetes Dashboard:** Unauthenticated or weakly authenticated Kubernetes dashboards exposing cluster state and control.
*   **Container Escape:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities within containerized applications to escape the container and gain access to the underlying node.
*   **Misconfigured RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):**  Insufficiently restrictive RBAC rules allowing unauthorized users or service accounts to perform sensitive operations.
*   **Weakly Protected Etcd Data:** Exposure or compromise of the etcd cluster, the Kubernetes backing store.
*   **Exploitable Services exposed via Ingress/Load Balancers:** Compromising applications exposed to the internet and using them as pivot point.
*   **Misconfigured Node Pools:** Allowing more privileged node pools than necessary or using older kubernetes versions that could be vulnerable.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data stored within the cluster.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting cluster operations and application availability.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining administrator-level access to the cluster.
*   **Resource Hijacking:**  Utilizing cluster resources for malicious purposes (e.g., cryptocurrency mining).
*   **Lateral Movement:** Moving between nodes and workloads within the cluster.
*   **Complete Cluster Compromise:**  Gaining full control over the entire Kubernetes cluster.

### Risk Level Assessment

The risk level associated with managed Kubernetes service vulnerabilities is generally considered **High** to **Critical**, depending on the specific vulnerability and its impact.  A publicly accessible, unauthenticated Kubernetes dashboard, for example, would be considered Critical.

### Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists

These vulnerabilities arise from:

*   **Default Configurations:** Managed Kubernetes services often come with default configurations that may not be secure by default.
*   **Complexity:** Kubernetes is a complex system, and misconfigurations are common, especially in areas like IAM and RBAC.
*   **Lack of Awareness:** Insufficient understanding of Kubernetes security best practices among developers and operations teams.
*   **Misunderstanding of Responsibility Model:**  Cloud providers typically share the responsibility for security. The user is responsible for correctly configuring the Kubernetes cluster and securing the application.
*   **Legacy Integrations:**  Integrating older applications that haven't been updated to use best-practice Kubernetes security patterns.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   Access to a managed Kubernetes cluster (e.g., AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE).
*   `kubectl` configured and authenticated to interact with the target cluster.
*   Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts (pods, services, deployments, namespaces, RBAC, etc.).
*   (Potentially) Cloud Provider CLI tools (e.g., AWS CLI, Azure CLI, gcloud CLI) if needing to retrieve IAM roles or cloud-specific configuration.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This section details the steps to validate and potentially exploit common managed Kubernetes service vulnerabilities.

### 2.1. Identifying an Exposed Kubernetes API Server (Unauthenticated)

**Validation:**

```bash
# Check if the API server is publicly accessible without authentication.
curl -k https://<kubernetes_api_server_address>/api/v1/namespaces

# Explanation:
# This command attempts to access the Kubernetes API server's /api/v1/namespaces endpoint without any authentication.
# -k: Allows insecure SSL connections (ignore certificate errors). Use cautiously in production environments.
# Replace <kubernetes_api_server_address> with the actual address of the Kubernetes API server.  This might be obtained from cloud provider control panel.
# Why:
# An accessible API server without proper authentication indicates a serious misconfiguration, allowing anyone to query and potentially control the cluster.

# Expected Output:
# If the API server is unauthenticated, this command will return a JSON response containing a list of namespaces.
# If authentication is required, it will return an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error.

# Contributing to Validation:
# A successful response confirms that the API server is publicly accessible without authentication.
```

**Exploitation:**

```bash
# List all pods in the default namespace.  Note: this is for demonstration purposes only. Actions like deletion can be performed depending on the RBAC roles.
kubectl get pods -n default --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true -s https://<kubernetes_api_server_address>

# Explanation:
# This command uses kubectl to list all pods in the default namespace of the target cluster.
# -n default: Specifies the default namespace.
# --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true: Skips TLS certificate verification (necessary if the API server's certificate is invalid or self-signed).  This SHOULD NOT be used in production.
# -s <kubernetes_api_server_address>: Specifies the API server address.
# Why:
# Demonstrates the ability to interact with the cluster's resources via the API server.  Successful output confirms the exploitable nature of the unauthenticated API server.

# Expected Output:
# A table listing all pods in the default namespace, along with their status and other information.

# Contributing to Exploitation:
# This confirms that an attacker can query the state of the cluster without authentication. Further actions like creating/deleting pods are possible if the default service account has sufficient permissions.
```

**Remediation:**

*   Enable authentication for the Kubernetes API server.
*   Implement robust RBAC policies to restrict access to cluster resources.
*   Consider using a private API endpoint or a VPN to restrict access to the API server from the public internet.

### 2.2. Exploiting Weak IAM Roles on Nodes (AWS EKS Example)

**Validation:**

```bash
# (Assumes you are on an EC2 instance acting as a Kubernetes node)
# Retrieve the instance metadata role
ROLE_ARN=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials | awk '{print $1}')/arn)
echo "Role ARN: $ROLE_ARN"

# Explanation:
# This command retrieves the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the IAM role assigned to the current EC2 instance acting as a Kubernetes node.
# It uses the EC2 instance metadata service to obtain the role information.
# Why:
# To determine the IAM role associated with the node, which may have excessive permissions.

# Expected Output:
# The ARN of the IAM role, e.g., arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/eksctl-mycluster-nodegroup-NodeInstanceRole-ABCDEFG12345

# Contributing to Validation:
# Identifies the IAM role that needs to be assessed for excessive permissions.
```

```bash
# Use AWS CLI to list the policies attached to the identified IAM role.
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name $(echo $ROLE_ARN | awk -F'/' '{print $2}') --output text --query AttachedPolicies[].PolicyName

# Explanation:
# This command lists all IAM policies directly attached to the identified role using the AWS CLI.
# `--role-name`:  Specifies the name of the IAM role (extracted from the ARN).
# `--output text`:  Formats the output as plain text.
# `--query AttachedPolicies[].PolicyName`:  Filters the output to only show the policy names.
# Why:
# To identify policies that might grant excessive permissions to the node.

# Expected Output:
# A list of IAM policy names attached to the role.  Look for overly permissive policies like "AdministratorAccess" or "S3FullAccess".

# Contributing to Validation:
# Identifying attached policies helps pinpoint potential permission escalation paths.
```

**Exploitation (Example: S3FullAccess)**

```bash
# (Assumes AWS CLI is configured with the node's IAM role's credentials)
# Attempt to list all S3 buckets in the account.
aws s3 ls

# Explanation:
# This command uses the AWS CLI to list all S3 buckets in the AWS account associated with the IAM role.
# It attempts to leverage the "S3FullAccess" policy (or equivalent) attached to the node's IAM role.
# Why:
# If the node has S3 read access, an attacker could steal sensitive data. If the node has S3 write access, an attacker could inject malicious data.

# Expected Output:
# If the IAM role has sufficient permissions (e.g., S3FullAccess), this command will list all S3 buckets in the account.
# If access is denied, it will return an "AccessDenied" error.

# Contributing to Exploitation:
#  Successful listing of S3 buckets confirms the ability to access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data.
```

**Remediation:**

*   Apply the principle of least privilege when assigning IAM roles to Kubernetes nodes.
*   Use more granular IAM policies that restrict access to only the resources that the node actually needs.
*   Regularly review and audit IAM roles and policies.

### 2.3. Identifying a Publicly Accessible Kubernetes Dashboard

**Validation:**

```bash
# Try to access the Kubernetes dashboard using a web browser or curl.
curl -k https://<kubernetes_dashboard_address>

# Explanation:
# This command attempts to access the Kubernetes dashboard at the specified address.
# -k: Allows insecure SSL connections (ignore certificate errors).
# Replace <kubernetes_dashboard_address> with the actual address of the Kubernetes dashboard.
# Why:
# To check if the dashboard is publicly accessible and if authentication is required.

# Expected Output:
# If the dashboard is publicly accessible without authentication, the command will return the HTML source code of the dashboard.
# If authentication is required, it will redirect to a login page or return an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error.  However, misconfigured dashboards may bypass authentication.

# Contributing to Validation:
#  Determines if the Kubernetes dashboard is exposed and whether authentication is required.  Exposed and unauthenticated dashboards are a critical security risk.
```

**Exploitation (if unauthenticated):**

Once identified, an unauthenticated dashboard allows full management of the cluster resources.  This includes deploying/deleting workloads, viewing secrets, and escalating privileges.  Specifically, one can:

1.  Create a privileged pod with access to the host's filesystem: This can be achieved by creating a pod definition with `hostPID: true`, `hostNetwork: true`, and `hostIPC: true`, as well as mounting the host filesystem.
2.  Use `kubectl exec` (or a similar method from within the pod's shell) to execute commands on the host node, effectively gaining root access.

**Remediation:**

*   Disable or remove the Kubernetes dashboard if it is not needed.
*   If the dashboard is required, ensure that it is properly secured with strong authentication (e.g., using kubeconfig files or a reverse proxy with authentication).
*   Implement RBAC to restrict access to the dashboard based on user roles and responsibilities.

### 2.4. Detecting Exposed Etcd Data (Very rare in managed clusters, but worth checking)

Managed Kubernetes clusters typically secure `etcd`, the Kubernetes backing store, however, misconfigurations sometimes occur or older versions can be vulnerable.

**Validation:**

```bash
# Try to connect to the etcd server directly.
# Note: You'll likely need to know the etcd endpoint and any TLS certificates or authentication credentials.  These are rarely exposed directly.  This is a theoretical check, more likely applicable to on-premise clusters.

# Example (assuming etcd is running on localhost:2379 and you have the required certificates):
etcdctl --endpoints=https://localhost:2379 --cacert=/path/to/ca.pem --cert=/path/to/cert.pem --key=/path/to/key.pem get / --prefix --keys-only

# Explanation:
# This command attempts to connect to the etcd server and list all keys.
# --endpoints: Specifies the etcd endpoint(s).
# --cacert, --cert, --key: Provide the necessary TLS certificates for secure communication with etcd.  Omit these if TLS is not enabled (HIGHLY UNLIKELY).
# get / --prefix --keys-only: Retrieves all keys in etcd.
# Why:
# An accessible etcd server without proper authentication allows an attacker to read or even modify the cluster's state, leading to complete cluster compromise.

# Expected Output:
# If access is granted, this command will list all the keys in the etcd store.
# If authentication is required or access is denied, it will return an error.

# Contributing to Validation:
#  Determines if the etcd server is accessible and if authentication is required.

```

**Remediation:**

*   Ensure that etcd is properly secured with strong authentication and encryption.
*   Restrict access to etcd to only authorized components (e.g., the Kubernetes API server).
*   Use TLS to encrypt communication between etcd and other components.  Managed Kubernetes providers typically handle this.

### 2.5 Node Pool Configuration Audit
```bash
#This will depend on your managed Kubernetes service.  The following are examples for AWS EKS and Azure AKS

# AWS EKS - Show the Kubernetes version of all node groups
aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster-name <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> --output text --query nodegroups[*].nodegroupName | xargs -I {} aws eks describe-nodegroup --cluster-name <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> --nodegroup-name {} --output text --query nodegroup.version

# Azure AKS - Show the Kubernetes version of all node pools
az aks show --resource-group <YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> --output json | jq '.agentPoolProfiles[] | {name: .name, kubernetesVersion: .kubernetesVersion}'

# Explanation: These commands use the cloud provider's CLI to list node pools and show their kubernetes version.
# Why: You are trying to identify node pools with older versions of Kubernetes that are vulnerable to exploits or missing the latest security patches.

#Contributing to Validation: This helps to identify node pools which are vulnerable.
```

**Remediation:**

* Ensure node pools are regularly updated to the latest Kubernetes version
* Use auto-upgrade features of your managed Kubernetes service provider if possible.
* Segregate sensitive workloads to node pools with the latest versions.

### 2.6 Exploitable Services exposed via Ingress/Load Balancers
This is an area to look for potential pivots into the Kubernetes cluster from a compromised application.

**Validation:**
```bash
# List all services of type LoadBalancer or NodePort in your cluster
kubectl get svc --all-namespaces -o wide

# Explanation: This command lists all services exposed through a load balancer or NodePort and their respective port mappings.
# Why: You are trying to identify exposed services, potentially with known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, that could act as an entry point to pivot into the Kubernetes cluster.

# Expected Output:
# A table showing all Kubernetes services and their details, including external IPs, ports, and selectors.

#Contributing to Validation: This helps to identify potential attack vectors.
```

**Exploitation:** Once an exploitable service is identified, you need to leverage any existing exploits or techniques against that application to compromise it. For example:

* **If a web application is exposed with a SQL Injection:** You could use SQL Injection to read environment variables that the application has access to, which might contain credentials for other services within the cluster or credentials used for connecting to cloud services.
* **If a service is unauthenticated or has weak authentication:** An attacker can gain access to the service and use it as a pivot point to exploit other services within the cluster.
* **If an application allows for arbitrary file uploads:** An attacker might be able to upload a shell and execute commands on the container.

**Remediation:**

* Ensure all services are secured with proper authentication and authorization.
* Regularly scan exposed services for known vulnerabilities.
* Implement network policies to restrict traffic between services.
* Apply the principle of least privilege for container permissions and network access.
* Harden exposed applications.
This documentation provides a solid foundation for penetration testing managed Kubernetes services. Remember to adapt and expand on these techniques based on the specific environment and cloud provider.  Always obtain proper authorization before conducting penetration tests.
