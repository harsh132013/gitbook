# Istio/Linkerd Authorization Policy Bypass Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

This document details a vulnerability that allows bypassing authorization policies in Istio or Linkerd service meshes. This vulnerability stems from misconfigurations or flaws in how authorization policies are defined and enforced, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive services within the mesh.

**Attack Vector Description:**

An attacker exploits misconfigured or missing authorization policies in Istio/Linkerd to gain unauthorized access to protected services within the mesh. This could involve crafting requests that appear legitimate based on incorrect policy definitions, or exploiting loopholes in the enforcement mechanisms. The attacker aims to access services they are not explicitly authorized to use.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored or processed by the targeted services.
*   **Service Disruption:** Ability to interfere with the normal operation of the targeted services, leading to denial-of-service or data corruption.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised service as a stepping stone to access other services within the mesh.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining elevated privileges by accessing services with higher permissions.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

Critical/High.  The ability to bypass authorization policies represents a significant security risk, potentially granting attackers complete control over the affected services and data. The likelihood of successful exploitation is dependent on the complexity and rigor of the authorization policies implemented. However, the impact of a successful bypass is typically severe.

**Technical Explanation:**

The vulnerability arises from several potential issues:

*   **Missing Policies:** Lack of authorization policies for specific services or paths, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized access.
*   **Overly Permissive Policies:** Policies that inadvertently grant excessive permissions to certain identities or groups. This can be due to wildcard usage, incorrect identity matching, or overly broad allow rules.
*   **Policy Evaluation Order:** Issues in how Istio/Linkerd evaluates authorization policies, leading to unintended precedence and bypasses.
*   **Identity Spoofing:** An attacker successfully impersonates a legitimate service identity, bypassing authorization checks based on identity.
*   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:** Using documented exploits against specific versions of Istio or Linkerd related to authorization enforcement.
*   **Injection Attacks:** In some cases, injection vulnerabilities in services relying on authorization data from the mesh could lead to bypassing intended checks.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   A deployed Kubernetes cluster with Istio or Linkerd service mesh installed and running.
*   At least one service protected by an authorization policy.
*   Knowledge of the services within the mesh, their roles, and the authorization policies that are intended to protect them.
*   Access to a tool for sending requests to services within the mesh (e.g., `kubectl port-forward`, `curl`, `grpcurl`, `hey`).
*   Credentials (or lack thereof) for a potential attacking client, allowing sending requests to protected services.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This section provides a step-by-step guide to validating and exploiting the Istio/Linkerd authorization policy bypass vulnerability.  This assumes a basic understanding of Istio/Linkerd concepts such as `ServiceEntry`, `VirtualService`, `AuthorizationPolicy`, and `PeerAuthentication`. This example will focus on Istio.

**Scenario**: We have a service called `sensitive-service` that is intended to only be accessed by `authorized-client`. There is an `AuthorizationPolicy` in place supposed to enforce this restriction. We want to see if we can bypass this policy using a `unauthorized-client`.

**Step 1: Deploy a Test Application and Authorization Policy (Initial Setup)**

This step assumes you don't have the example application.  If you do, skip to Step 2. We will use `kubectl` to deploy a simple server and client.  These deployments are for demonstration only and may need adjusting for your environment.

```bash
# Create a namespace for the test application
kubectl create namespace test-authz

# Deploy a "sensitive-service" (server) that returns a secret
kubectl apply -n test-authz -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sensitive-service
  labels:
    app: sensitive-service
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sensitive-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sensitive-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sensitive-service
        image: kennethreitz/httpbin
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: SECRET
          value: "ThisIsASecret"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sensitive-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: sensitive-service
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
EOF

# Deploy an "authorized-client"
kubectl apply -n test-authz -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: authorized-client
  labels:
    app: authorized-client
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: authorized-client
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: authorized-client
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: authorized-client
        image: curlimages/curl
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do sleep 3600;done"]
EOF

# Deploy an "unauthorized-client"
kubectl apply -n test-authz -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: unauthorized-client
  labels:
    app: unauthorized-client
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: unauthorized-client
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: unauthorized-client
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: unauthorized-client
        image: curlimages/curl
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "while true; do sleep 3600;done"]
EOF
```

**Explanation:** These commands create a dedicated namespace, deploy a simple "sensitive-service" using `httpbin` which returns an env variable as a simple API endpoint.  The `authorized-client` and `unauthorized-client` are deployments of `curlimages/curl` in sleep mode so we can execute commands inside these containers.

**Expected Output:** The commands should successfully create the deployments and services in the `test-authz` namespace.

```
namespace/test-authz created
deployment.apps/sensitive-service created
service/sensitive-service created
deployment.apps/authorized-client created
deployment.apps/unauthorized-client created
```

**Step 2:  Configure Istio to inject Envoy sidecars**

This step assumes automatic sidecar injection is NOT enabled at the namespace level.

```bash
# Label the namespace for Istio sidecar injection
kubectl label namespace test-authz istio-injection=enabled
```

**Explanation:**  This command tells Istio to inject the Envoy sidecar proxy into any new pods created in the `test-authz` namespace. The sidecar is essential for enforcing Istio policies.

**Expected Output:**
```
namespace/test-authz labeled
```

**Step 3: Verify Sidecar Injection (Important)**

Ensure the pods are re-created with the Istio sidecar.  Delete and recreate the pods or wait for a rolling update.

```bash
kubectl delete pod -n test-authz -l app=sensitive-service
kubectl delete pod -n test-authz -l app=authorized-client
kubectl delete pod -n test-authz -l app=unauthorized-client
```

**Explanation:** Deleting the pods will force a recreation, and the Istio sidecar injector will add the Envoy proxy container to the pod.

**Expected Output:** The command should delete the existing pods.

```
pod "sensitive-service-xxxxxxx" deleted
pod "authorized-client-xxxxxxx" deleted
pod "unauthorized-client-xxxxxxx" deleted
```

Then, verify the pods have been recreated and the sidecar is present.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n test-authz
```

**Expected Output:**

```
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
authorized-client-xxxxxxxx           2/2     Running   0          10s
sensitive-service-xxxxxxxx           2/2     Running   0          10s
unauthorized-client-xxxxxxxx         2/2     Running   0          10s
```

**Important:**  Ensure that `READY` is `2/2` for all pods.  This indicates that the sidecar proxy has been injected and is running.

**Step 4: Create an AuthorizationPolicy**

This policy intends to ONLY allow the `authorized-client` to access the `sensitive-service`.

```bash
kubectl apply -n test-authz -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: AuthorizationPolicy
metadata:
  name: sensitive-service-authz
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sensitive-service
  action: ALLOW
  rules:
  - from:
    - source:
        principals: ["cluster.local/ns/test-authz/sa/default"] # Assuming default SA for the client
EOF
```

**Explanation:** This `AuthorizationPolicy` targets pods labeled with `app: sensitive-service`.  It allows requests originating from the `default` service account in the `test-authz` namespace. This is where we assume our `authorized-client` will run.

**Expected Output:**

```
authorizationpolicy.security.istio.io/sensitive-service-authz created
```

**Step 5: Determine the Service Account for the authorized-client (Important)**

We must ensure our `authorized-client` is indeed running with the assumed ServiceAccount.

```bash
kubectl get pod -n test-authz -l app=authorized-client -o yaml | grep serviceAccountName:
```

**Expected Output:**

```
  serviceAccountName: default
```

If it's not `default`, you will need to adjust the `principals` value in the `AuthorizationPolicy`.

**Step 6:  Test Access from the Authorized Client**

First, get the name of the `authorized-client` pod.

```bash
AUTHORIZED_CLIENT_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n test-authz -l app=authorized-client -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
echo $AUTHORIZED_CLIENT_POD
```

Then, test access from within the `authorized-client` pod.  We'll port-forward `sensitive-service` to the local machine to simplify the curl request inside the pod.

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n test-authz svc/sensitive-service 8080:80 &

sleep 5 # give port-forward time to start

kubectl exec -n test-authz $AUTHORIZED_CLIENT_POD -- curl -s localhost:8080 | jq .headers.SECRET
```

**Explanation:**

*   We find the name of the `authorized-client` pod using `kubectl get pod` and store it in a variable.
*   We then use `kubectl exec` to run a `curl` command *inside* the `authorized-client` pod.  This simulates a request from a properly authorized client.
*   `jq .headers.SECRET` extracts the `SECRET` environment variable which is a simple validation that the HTTP request was successful.

**Expected Output:**

```
"ThisIsASecret"
```

This indicates that the `authorized-client` can access the `sensitive-service`, as expected.

**Step 7:  Test Access from the Unauthorized Client (Vulnerability Validation)**

Similar to Step 6, get the pod name and try accessing the `sensitive-service`.

```bash
UNAUTHORIZED_CLIENT_POD=$(kubectl get pod -n test-authz -l app=unauthorized-client -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
echo $UNAUTHORIZED_CLIENT_POD

kubectl exec -n test-authz $UNAUTHORIZED_CLIENT_POD -- curl -s localhost:8080
```

**Explanation:** This command executes `curl` *inside* the `unauthorized-client` pod, attempting to access the `sensitive-service`.

**Expected Output:** Ideally, the response should be a `403 Forbidden` error, because the authorization policy *should* be denying access.  However, let's analyze potential bypass scenarios:

*   **Bypass Scenario 1: Policy Not Applied Correctly:** If the output shows the `SECRET` value (or the full httpbin response), the authorization policy is not being enforced or has been incorrectly configured.

    ```json
    {
      "args": {},
      "data": "",
      "files": {},
      "form": {},
      "headers": {
        "Accept": "*/*",
        "Host": "localhost:8080",
        "User-Agent": "curl/7.81.0",
        "X-Envoy-Attempt-Count": "1"
      },
      "json": null,
      "method": "GET",
      "origin": "10.244.1.44",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/"
    }
    ```

    This constitutes a **direct vulnerability**.

*   **Bypass Scenario 2: Exploiting Missing/Insufficient Host-Based Routing:**

    Let's assume our port forward is interfering with the policy.  We need the internal DNS name for `sensitive-service`.

    ```bash
    INTERNAL_DNS_NAME=$(kubectl get svc -n test-authz sensitive-service -o jsonpath='{.metadata.name}.{.metadata.namespace}.svc.cluster.local')
    echo $INTERNAL_DNS_NAME

    kubectl exec -n test-authz $UNAUTHORIZED_CLIENT_POD -- curl -s $INTERNAL_DNS_NAME
    ```

    If this returns a success (not 403), the authorization policy may not be enforcing rules based on the proper Host header, which could be a weakness.

*   **Bypass Scenario 3: Mismatched Service Accounts:** Verify the ServiceAccount of both clients using `kubectl get pod -n test-authz -l app=... -o yaml | grep serviceAccountName:`. If both clients are using the same ServiceAccount for whatever reason, the unauthorized client would be effectively authorized.

**Step 8: Attempt Identity Spoofing (Advanced)**

This requires knowledge of the certificate structure and configuration.  If the mesh allows external traffic and doesn't properly validate client certificates, it might be possible to craft a request with a forged or stolen identity. This is a complex attack and highly environment-specific.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Implement a default-deny policy:**  Start with a policy that denies all traffic and then explicitly allow necessary traffic.
*   **Define specific and granular authorization policies:**  Avoid using wildcards unless absolutely necessary.  Clearly define which clients are allowed to access which services and endpoints.
*   **Regularly audit authorization policies:**  Review and update policies to ensure they are still appropriate and effective.
*   **Use strong authentication mechanisms:**  Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) to authenticate both clients and servers.
*   **Keep Istio/Linkerd up to date:**  Install the latest security patches to address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitor and log access attempts:**  Monitor for suspicious activity and log all access attempts to protected services.
*   **Validate Service Accounts:** Ensure applications use distinct service accounts. If two applications use the same service account, one could mistakenly gain access to resources only intended for the other.
*   **Strict Host Header Validation:** Configure Istio/Linkerd to perform strict validation of the Host header in incoming requests. This ensures that requests are routed to the correct service and prevents malicious actors from spoofing the Host header to bypass authorization policies.

This detailed documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, validating, and exploiting an Istio/Linkerd authorization policy bypass vulnerability. It also includes practical remediation recommendations to mitigate the risk. Remember to always conduct penetration testing with proper authorization and within a controlled environment.
