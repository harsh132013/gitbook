# Kubernetes Penetration Testing: Load Balancer Misconfigurations

## 1. Overview

### Attack Vector Description

Load balancers in Kubernetes, often exposed externally, distribute traffic to the appropriate services within the cluster. Misconfigurations in load balancer settings can expose sensitive services directly to the internet, bypass intended access controls, or allow attackers to manipulate traffic routing for malicious purposes. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, and other severe consequences. The specific attack vector depends on the exact misconfiguration, ranging from overly permissive access control lists (ACLs) to insecure port forwarding.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

*   **Unauthorized Access to Internal Services:** Direct access to internal services like databases or administrative panels, bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms within the cluster.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive data from exposed databases or services.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overloading services by exploiting misconfigured routing rules or leveraging exposed endpoints.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining access to sensitive resources by exploiting exposed management interfaces.
*   **Container Escape:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in exposed applications that could lead to container escape and host compromise.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical** (if sensitive services are directly exposed without authentication/authorization)

**High** (if misconfigurations allow bypassing intended security controls or lead to DoS)

**Medium** (if misconfigurations expose non-sensitive services or require further exploitation steps)

### Technical Explanation

Load balancer misconfigurations arise due to various reasons:

*   **Default Configurations:** Using default load balancer configurations without proper customization, which may include overly permissive access rules.
*   **Incorrect Service Annotations:** Improperly configured annotations that define how the load balancer interacts with Kubernetes services (e.g., incorrect `externalTrafficPolicy`).
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Lack of proper network policies or firewall rules restricting access to the load balancer's exposed ports.
*   **Insecure Port Mapping:** Mapping sensitive ports (e.g., database ports) directly to the load balancer without proper security measures.
*   **Exposure of Management Interfaces:** Unintentionally exposing management interfaces of databases or other critical services via the load balancer.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Access to the Kubernetes Cluster:** Requires access to the cluster's external IP address or hostname associated with the load balancer.
*   **Network Connectivity:** Need network connectivity to the exposed load balancer ports.
*   **Basic Kubernetes Knowledge:** Familiarity with Kubernetes services, deployments, and load balancer concepts is essential.
*   **Tools:** Standard network tools like `nmap`, `curl`, `kubectl` and `dig` are beneficial.
*   **kubectl Configuration:** `kubectl` configured to access the Kubernetes cluster (optional, but helpful for gathering information).
*   **Cloud Provider Credentials (Optional):** If using a cloud provider load balancer, access to the provider's console can be helpful for further analysis and configuration review.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This section outlines the steps to identify and exploit potential load balancer misconfigurations. We'll focus on detecting overly permissive configurations and exposed sensitive services.

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Identification**

**Step 1: Discovering the Load Balancer's IP Address**

```bash
kubectl get svc --all-namespaces -o wide
```

*   **Explanation:** This command retrieves information about all services across all namespaces, including their external IP addresses.
*   **Why:** To identify services of type `LoadBalancer` and obtain their associated IP addresses. This is the entry point for external access.
*   **Expected Output:** A table listing services with their names, namespaces, types (including LoadBalancer), external IPs, and other details.
*   **What to Look For:** Services with type `LoadBalancer` and an external IP address. Note the namespace and name of the service.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** If `kubectl` is unavailable, you can use the cloud provider's console to identify load balancers associated with the Kubernetes cluster.

**Step 2: Identifying Open Ports with Nmap**

```bash
nmap -p- <LOAD_BALANCER_IP>
```

*   **Explanation:** This command performs a full TCP port scan of the load balancer's IP address.
*   **Why:** To identify all open ports on the load balancer.
*   **Expected Output:** A list of open TCP ports and their associated service names (if nmap can identify them).
*   **What to Look For:**  Unusual or unexpected open ports. Specifically, look for ports associated with databases (3306, 5432), management interfaces (8080, 9000), or other potentially sensitive services.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Use a more targeted port scan if you have prior knowledge of potential services running behind the load balancer: `nmap -p 80,443,3306,5432 <LOAD_BALANCER_IP>`

**Step 3: Banner Grabbing for Service Identification**

For each interesting open port identified in Step 2, attempt to grab the service banner:

```bash
nmap -sV -p <PORT> <LOAD_BALANCER_IP>
```

*   **Explanation:** This command attempts to determine the service and version running on the specified port using banner grabbing. `-sV` enables version detection.
*   **Why:** To identify the specific service running on the open port and its version number. This is critical for identifying potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Expected Output:** The service banner, which typically includes the service name, version, and other identifying information.
*   **What to Look For:** The service and version information. This allows you to research known vulnerabilities associated with that specific software.  Look for banners that reveal internal services not meant to be exposed.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Use `netcat` or `telnet` to manually connect to the port and attempt to retrieve the banner: `nc <LOAD_BALANCER_IP> <PORT>` or `telnet <LOAD_BALANCER_IP> <PORT>`. Then, manually type a newline character and see if the server responds with a banner.

**Phase 2: Validation and Exploitation**

**Scenario 1: Exposed Database (Port 3306)**

Let's assume `nmap` reveals port 3306 (MySQL) is open and accessible directly on the load balancer's IP address.

**Step 4: Attempt to Connect to the Database**

```bash
mysql -h <LOAD_BALANCER_IP> -P 3306 -u root -p
```

*   **Explanation:** This command attempts to connect to the MySQL database using the default `root` user.
*   **Why:** To check if default credentials are used or if the database is exposed without authentication.
*   **Expected Output:**  If successful, a MySQL command prompt (`mysql>`). If unsuccessful, an error message indicating authentication failure or connection refused.
*   **What to Look For:**  Successful connection without a password prompt indicates a highly critical vulnerability. A failed connection attempt may still be exploitable if common default passwords are used.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Use `nmap` to try to fingerprint the exact MySQL version and then search for version specific exploits.

**Step 5: Attempt to Enumerate Databases**

If the connection is successful (no password required):

```sql
SHOW DATABASES;
```

*   **Explanation:** This MySQL command lists all databases accessible to the current user.
*   **Why:** To identify potentially sensitive databases within the MySQL instance.
*   **Expected Output:** A list of database names.
*   **What to Look For:** Database names that suggest sensitive data (e.g., "users", "secrets", "production_data").

**Step 6: Extract Sensitive Data (If Access Granted)**

```sql
USE <DATABASE_NAME>;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM <TABLE_NAME>;
```

*   **Explanation:** These MySQL commands select a specific database, list its tables, and then select all data from a specific table. Replace `<DATABASE_NAME>` and `<TABLE_NAME>` with the appropriate values.
*   **Why:** To extract sensitive data from the database, demonstrating the impact of the vulnerability.
*   **Expected Output:** The data stored in the selected table.
*   **What to Look For:** Sensitive data like usernames, passwords, API keys, credit card numbers, etc.

**Scenario 2: Exposed Kubernetes Dashboard (Port 8080 or 8443)**

Let's assume `nmap` reveals port 8080 or 8443 is open and presents a Kubernetes dashboard.

**Step 4: Access the Kubernetes Dashboard**

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<LOAD_BALANCER_IP>:8080` or `https://<LOAD_BALANCER_IP>:8443`.

*   **Explanation:** Attempt to access the Kubernetes dashboard directly through the load balancer.
*   **Why:** To check if the dashboard is exposed without proper authentication or authorization.
*   **Expected Output:** A login prompt or, even worse, direct access to the Kubernetes dashboard.
*   **What to Look For:** Direct access to the dashboard without authentication is a critical finding. If a login is required, attempt to bypass authentication using known exploits or default credentials.
*   **Alternative Approaches:** Check the certificate if using HTTPS to see if it's using a self-signed or default certificate which indicates poor security practices.

**Step 5: Check for RBAC Permissions (If Access Granted)**

If you gain access to the Kubernetes dashboard, check the permissions of the current user or service account.

*   **Explanation:** Assess what actions the currently logged-in user or service account can perform.
*   **Why:** To determine the extent of the attacker's control over the cluster.
*   **How:**  Use the dashboard's interface to explore the available resources and actions. Look for the ability to create, modify, or delete deployments, services, or other critical resources.

**Step 6: Attempt to Escalate Privileges (If Possible)**

If the current user has sufficient permissions, attempt to escalate privileges by creating or modifying resources:

*   **Create a Privileged Pod:** Create a pod with hostNetwork=true and access to the host's filesystem to potentially gain access to the underlying host.
*   **Modify Existing Deployments:** Modify existing deployments to execute malicious code or gain access to sensitive data.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Implement Proper Authentication and Authorization:** Ensure all services exposed through the load balancer require proper authentication and authorization.  Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication where possible.
*   **Apply Network Policies:** Use Kubernetes network policies to restrict traffic flow between pods and services, minimizing the attack surface.
*   **Secure Load Balancer Configuration:** Configure the load balancer with strict access control lists (ACLs) to allow only necessary traffic.  Disable unnecessary ports and protocols.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Keep Software Up-to-Date:** Keep all Kubernetes components and applications up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Review Service Annotations:** Carefully review all service annotations related to load balancer configuration (e.g., `externalTrafficPolicy`, `loadBalancerSourceRanges`) to ensure they are configured correctly. The `externalTrafficPolicy` should typically be set to `Local` to preserve source IP addresses and prevent unnecessary traffic forwarding.
*   **Implement Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** Implement IDPS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity and automatically respond to threats.

This documentation provides a starting point for identifying and exploiting load balancer misconfigurations in Kubernetes. Remember that the specific steps and vulnerabilities will vary depending on the environment and configuration. Always perform penetration testing with proper authorization and in a controlled environment.
