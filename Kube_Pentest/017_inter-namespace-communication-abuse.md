# Kubernetes Inter-Namespace Communication Abuse Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

This document describes the vulnerability of abusing inter-namespace communication in Kubernetes, allowing attackers to access and manipulate resources in other namespaces they are not authorized to access directly.

### Attack Vector Description

The attack vector involves leveraging Kubernetes' service discovery and network policies (or lack thereof) to bypass intended namespace isolation. Attackers can exploit misconfigured or non-existent network policies, along with service discovery mechanisms like DNS, to communicate with pods in other namespaces. By crafting specific requests and exploiting trust relationships, attackers can potentially access sensitive data, modify configurations, or even execute arbitrary code in the target namespace.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive data stored in pods within other namespaces, such as database credentials, API keys, and personally identifiable information (PII).
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges by compromising workloads with more access rights in another namespace.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting services in other namespaces by overloading or crashing pods.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Expanding the attack surface by using compromised pods as stepping stones to target other systems within the cluster or connected networks.
*   **Compliance Violations:** Failing to comply with regulatory requirements due to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical/High** (depending on the sensitivity of data and services exposed)

### Technical Explanation

Kubernetes namespaces provide a way to logically isolate resources within a cluster. However, this isolation is not guaranteed by default.  Services are discoverable across namespaces via DNS using the format `<service-name>.<namespace-name>.svc.cluster.local`. If network policies are not properly configured to restrict cross-namespace traffic, pods in one namespace can freely communicate with services in other namespaces. This can be exploited if a service in the target namespace has vulnerabilities (e.g., an unauthenticated API endpoint, a vulnerable library, or a misconfigured application).

The vulnerability exists because Kubernetes allows inter-namespace communication by default.  Effective namespace isolation relies heavily on explicitly configured network policies to restrict unwanted traffic.  Without these policies, the default behavior is to allow all traffic between namespaces.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Kubernetes cluster with multiple namespaces.**
*   **A pod (the attacker's pod) within a namespace (the attacker's namespace) that can execute commands (e.g., using `kubectl exec`).**
*   **A target service in another namespace (the target namespace) that the attacker wants to access.**
*   **Lack of adequate network policies preventing inter-namespace communication.**
*   **Knowledge of the target service name and namespace.**
*   **Potential vulnerability in the target service that can be exploited upon successful communication (e.g., a vulnerable API endpoint).**

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

### Validation Phase: Discovering Services and Probing Network Connectivity

1.  **Identify Target Namespace and Service:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get services --all-namespaces
    ```

    **Explanation:** This command lists all services in all namespaces within the Kubernetes cluster.

    **Why:** To identify potential target services in other namespaces and determine their names and namespaces.

    **Expected Output:** A list of services, their namespaces, and their endpoints.  Look for services in namespaces you don't have explicit access to that might be interesting targets.

    **Example Output:**

    ```
    NAMESPACE     NAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE
    default       kubernetes                 ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP                  29d
    kube-system   kube-dns                   ClusterIP   10.96.0.10       <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   29d
    production    api-service                ClusterIP   10.101.1.20      <none>        80/TCP                   12h
    ```

    In this example, `api-service` in the `production` namespace looks interesting.

2.  **Identify Attacker Pod:**

    Choose a pod in a different namespace from the target.

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n <attacker-namespace>
    ```

    **Explanation:** Lists all pods in the attacker's namespace.

    **Why:** To determine the name of a pod that can be used as a launchpad for the attack.

    **Expected Output:** A list of pods and their statuses.  Pick a pod that is running and accessible.

    **Example:**

    ```
    NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    attacker-pod-6d6859b7bb-5q686   1/1     Running   0          5h
    ```

    We'll use `attacker-pod-6d6859b7bb-5q686` as our attacker pod.  Replace `<attacker-namespace>` with the actual namespace name.

3.  **Test Basic DNS Resolution and Network Connectivity:**

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it attacker-pod-6d6859b7bb-5q686 -n <attacker-namespace> -- nslookup api-service.production.svc.cluster.local
    ```

    **Explanation:** Executes `nslookup` inside the attacker's pod to resolve the DNS name of the target service.

    **Why:** To verify that the target service's DNS name can be resolved from within the attacker's namespace.  Successful resolution is a crucial first step.

    **Expected Output:** If DNS resolution is successful, you'll see the IP address associated with the target service.  If it fails, there might be DNS configuration issues.

    **Example Successful Output:**

    ```
    Server:         10.96.0.10
    Address:        10.96.0.10#53

    Name:   api-service.production.svc.cluster.local
    Address: 10.101.1.20
    ```

    **Example Failed Output:**

    ```
    Server:         10.96.0.10
    Address:        10.96.0.10#53

    ** server can't find api-service.production.svc.cluster.local: NXDOMAIN
    ```

    If DNS resolution fails, investigate DNS configuration within the cluster.  It's a fundamental requirement for inter-namespace communication.

4.  **Test TCP Connectivity to the Target Service:**

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it attacker-pod-6d6859b7bb-5q686 -n <attacker-namespace> -- nc -vz api-service.production.svc.cluster.local 80
    ```

    **Explanation:** Executes `nc` (netcat) inside the attacker's pod to test TCP connectivity to the target service on port 80.  If `nc` is not available in the pod, try `telnet` or install `nc`.

    **Why:** To verify if network policies are blocking traffic between the attacker's pod and the target service.

    **Expected Output:**

    *   **Successful Connection:** Indicates that network policies are not blocking the traffic.

    ```
    Connection to api-service.production.svc.cluster.local 80 port [tcp/http] succeeded!
    ```

    *   **Failed Connection:** Indicates that network policies are likely blocking the traffic.

    ```
    nc: connect to api-service.production.svc.cluster.local port 80 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
    ```

    If the connection is refused, it's likely that network policies are in place preventing inter-namespace communication.  This would hinder the exploit.

    **Alternative:**  If `nc` is unavailable, you can try installing it within the pod (if possible) using package managers like `apt-get` or `yum`, or use a tool like `telnet`:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it attacker-pod-6d6859b7bb-5q686 -n <attacker-namespace> -- telnet api-service.production.svc.cluster.local 80
    ```

    A successful telnet connection will display `Connected to api-service.production.svc.cluster.local`.

### Exploitation Phase: Accessing and Exploiting the Target Service

**Assuming successful connectivity to the target service (e.g., `api-service` in the `production` namespace on port 80), proceed with the following steps.** This section assumes the api-service has an unprotected endpoint at `/info`. Adapt the commands to the specifics of the target service.

1.  **Access the Target Service via `curl`:**

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it attacker-pod-6d6859b7bb-5q686 -n <attacker-namespace> -- curl http://api-service.production.svc.cluster.local/info
    ```

    **Explanation:**  Uses `curl` inside the attacker's pod to send an HTTP request to the `/info` endpoint of the target service.

    **Why:**  To attempt to access the service and potentially retrieve sensitive information or trigger an action.

    **Expected Output:**

    *   **Success (Vulnerable):** The service responds with data, indicating that it's accessible and potentially vulnerable.  This could be sensitive data, API keys, or configuration details.

    ```json
    {"version": "1.0", "environment": "production", "database_url": "example.com"}
    ```

    *   **Failure (Potentially Mitigated):** The service returns an error (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 401 Unauthorized), or the connection times out, indicating that access is restricted (but not definitively).

    ```html
    <html><body><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></body></html>
    ```

2. **Exploitation Example - Sending Malicious Payloads**

    Let's assume the API service has a known vulnerability where a specific HTTP header can trigger a command injection.

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it attacker-pod-6d6859b7bb-5q686 -n <attacker-namespace> -- curl -H "X-Custom-Header: $(whoami)" http://api-service.production.svc.cluster.local/
    ```

    **Explanation:** Sends a crafted `curl` request to the target service with a malicious HTTP header (`X-Custom-Header`) containing a command injection payload (`$(whoami)`). This is just an example. The payload should match the known vulnerability of the API.

    **Why:** Attempts to exploit a known vulnerability in the target service by injecting a command. If the service is vulnerable, the `whoami` command will be executed on the target server.

    **Expected Output:**
    * **Success:** If the target service is vulnerable to command injection via the `X-Custom-Header`, the output will contain the result of the `whoami` command execution. The exact output will depend on the target environment.

    * **Failure:**  No output, an error message, or no reflection of injected command indicates the target is not vulnerable, or the vector is not correct.

**Important Considerations:**

*   This exploitation phase is highly dependent on the specific vulnerabilities present in the target service. The examples provided are illustrative.
*   Carefully research the target service to identify potential vulnerabilities before attempting exploitation.
*   Ensure you have the necessary permissions to conduct penetration testing activities and that you are operating within a legal and ethical framework.

### Remediation Recommendations

*   **Implement Network Policies:** Create and enforce network policies to explicitly define allowed traffic between namespaces. Deny all inter-namespace traffic by default and then selectively allow specific communication based on application requirements. This is the most important mitigation.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** Apply the principle of least privilege to service accounts and RBAC roles. Grant only the necessary permissions for pods to access the resources they require, minimizing the potential impact of a compromise.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in your Kubernetes environment.
*   **Secure Service Configuration:** Harden the configuration of your services to prevent unauthorized access and exploitation. This may include implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, restricting access to sensitive API endpoints, and regularly patching software.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual network traffic patterns.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege Network Access**: Make each container only able to access the network services it needs. This can be achieved with network policies that filter traffic based on ports, protocols and namespaces
*   **Harden Network Policies with strict egress rules:** Restrict the pod's ability to make outgoing connections, especially to other namespaces. Define exactly what namespaces and services it *needs* to contact to work properly.

By implementing these remediation measures, you can significantly improve the security of your Kubernetes environment and reduce the risk of inter-namespace communication abuse.
