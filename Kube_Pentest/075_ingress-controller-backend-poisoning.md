# Kubernetes Ingress Controller Backend Poisoning Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

**Attack Vector Description:**

Ingress controller backend poisoning occurs when an attacker can manipulate the HTTP Host header or other relevant request headers to redirect traffic from a legitimate domain managed by the Ingress controller to a different backend service, potentially one controlled by the attacker. This is achievable if the Ingress controller configuration is improperly validated or relies solely on the Host header for routing decisions without proper sanitization. An attacker essentially "poisons" the routing table by tricking the controller into routing traffic destined for a valid service to a malicious one.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Redirecting traffic to a malicious backend allows the attacker to intercept sensitive data intended for the legitimate application, such as user credentials, API keys, or personally identifiable information (PII).
*   **Phishing:** The attacker can serve a fake login page that closely resembles the real one, tricking users into entering their credentials.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overloading the attacker-controlled backend or simply refusing to serve requests effectively makes the legitimate application unavailable.
*   **Code Injection/Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the attacker-controlled backend is vulnerable to code injection or RCE, the compromised host can be further exploited to gain access to the Kubernetes cluster or other connected systems.
*   **Reputation Damage:** The organization's reputation suffers if users are victims of phishing or have their data stolen.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

*   **Critical** if sensitive data is exposed or RCE is achievable.
*   **High** if data exfiltration or phishing is possible.
*   **Medium** if only DoS is possible or the impact is limited.

**Technical Explanation:**

Ingress controllers use the `Host` header in HTTP requests to determine which backend service to route the request to. If the Ingress configuration doesn't properly validate or sanitize the `Host` header, an attacker can manipulate it to point to a different service within the cluster or even an external service. This misconfiguration allows the attacker to bypass the intended routing rules. Weaknesses in Ingress controller plugins or extensions that manipulate request routing can also introduce this vulnerability. Some examples of how this can occur:
    * Ingress configurations that use wildcard `Host` matches without sufficient precautions.
    * Reliance on `Host` header without validating against an approved list of hosts.
    * Insecure use of `rewrite-target` or similar features.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the Kubernetes cluster or the exposed Ingress controller.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Ingress controller.
*   The Ingress controller must be configured in a way that allows manipulating the `Host` header to influence routing decisions.  This often involves wildcard subdomains or missing explicit host definitions.
*   A rogue service controlled by the attacker, either within or external to the cluster, to which traffic can be redirected.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

**Phase 1: Validation - Identify Potentially Vulnerable Ingresses**

1.  **List Ingress resources:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get ingress -A
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command lists all Ingress resources across all namespaces in the cluster.
    *   **Why:**  This provides an overview of available Ingresses and their configurations.  We're looking for Ingresses that might be vulnerable due to wildcard domains, lack of host definitions, or unusual configurations.
    *   **Expected Output:** A table listing Ingress names, namespaces, hosts, addresses, ports, and age.
    *   **Look for:** Ingresses with `*` in the HOSTS column, empty HOSTS columns, or Ingresses without TLS configuration that might be easier to manipulate.

2.  **Describe a specific Ingress resource (replace `<ingress-name>` and `<namespace>`):**

    ```bash
    kubectl describe ingress <ingress-name> -n <namespace>
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command retrieves detailed information about a specific Ingress resource.
    *   **Why:** We need to examine the Ingress configuration to understand its routing rules and identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Expected Output:** A detailed description of the Ingress, including its rules, backend services, TLS configuration, and annotations.
    *   **Look for:**
        *   Wildcard hostnames (`*.example.com`).
        *   Backend services that appear unusual or suspicious.
        *   Annotations related to rewriting or other request manipulation.
        *   Absence of strong TLS configurations.
        *   Any annotations that suggest the Ingress controller relies heavily on the `Host` header without strong validation. For example, annotations like `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /` often work in conjunction with the Host header to rewrite the request.

**Phase 2: Exploitation - Attempting Backend Poisoning**

1.  **Deploy a malicious backend service (replace placeholders):**

    ```bash
    kubectl create deployment attacker-pod --image=nginx -n attacker
    kubectl expose deployment attacker-pod --port=80 --type=ClusterIP -n attacker
    kubectl get svc -n attacker # Get the attacker service name and cluster IP
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** These commands create a simple Nginx deployment and service in a dedicated `attacker` namespace. This will act as the malicious backend.
    *   **Why:** We need a backend service to redirect the traffic to. Nginx is a common choice for its ease of setup. This could be something more sophisticated such as a honeypot, or service designed to extract information.
    *   **Expected Output:**  Success messages for each command, and the Service name and ClusterIP of the attacker service.
    *   **Note:**  If you already have an external server you control, you can skip this step and use its IP address/hostname in the subsequent steps.

2.  **Craft a malicious request using `curl` (replace placeholders):**

    ```bash
    INGRESS_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get ingress <ingress-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}') # Gets the IP address of the ingress controller
    ATTACKER_SERVICE_NAME=$(kubectl get svc -n attacker attacker-pod -o jsonpath='{.metadata.name}')
    ATTACKER_SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc -n attacker attacker-pod -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')

    curl -H "Host: <vulnerable-hostname>" http://$INGRESS_ADDRESS/ -v
    curl -H "Host: <vulnerable-hostname>" http://$INGRESS_ADDRESS/ -v --resolve <vulnerable-hostname>:80:$ATTACKER_SERVICE_IP # Uses --resolve to spoof the DNS
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command sends an HTTP request to the Ingress controller, manipulating the `Host` header.  The first curl command relies on DNS to resolve correctly. The second curl command uses `--resolve` to bypass DNS entirely and directly associate the vulnerable hostname with the attacker's service IP. This forces the Ingress controller to route the request to the attacker's backend if the `Host` header is the only factor determining routing.
    *   **Why:** We're trying to force the Ingress controller to route the request to our malicious backend instead of the intended service by spoofing the `Host` header and potentially also spoofing the DNS lookup. Replace `<vulnerable-hostname>` with the hostname observed from the Ingress description.  If the Ingress has a wildcard host like `*.example.com`, try a subdomain like `evil.example.com`.
    *   **Expected Output:**  The HTML content served by the attacker's Nginx server if the attack is successful.  The `-v` option provides verbose output, including the HTTP headers received.
    *   **Look for:** The HTML content of the attacker's service instead of the content expected from the legitimate service. The verbose output (`-v`) will show the server headers, confirming the request was routed to the attacker's nginx server.

3.  **Verify traffic redirection (Check attacker's service logs):**

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -l app=attacker-pod -n attacker
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  This command retrieves the logs from the attacker's Nginx pod.
    *   **Why:** To confirm that the attacker's service is receiving the redirected traffic.
    *   **Expected Output:**  Log entries showing the HTTP requests that were redirected to the attacker's service.  Look for log lines indicating requests for the expected path.

**Phase 3: Exploitation - Data Exfiltration (Example)**

*This phase assumes the attacker's backend can log requests.*

1.  **Craft a more targeted request:**

    ```bash
    INGRESS_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get ingress <ingress-name> -n <namespace> -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
    ATTACKER_SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc -n attacker attacker-pod -o jsonpath='{.spec.clusterIP}')
    curl -H "Host: <vulnerable-hostname>" http://$INGRESS_ADDRESS/api/sensitive-data -v --resolve <vulnerable-hostname>:80:$ATTACKER_SERVICE_IP
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command sends a request to a specific endpoint of the legitimate application that is likely to return sensitive data.  Replace `/api/sensitive-data` with a real endpoint.
    *   **Why:** To demonstrate data exfiltration, we need to target an endpoint that exposes sensitive information.
    *   **Expected Output:** The response from the attacker's service.  It's unlikely to return the expected data, but the request will have been logged.

2.  **Analyze attacker's service logs:**

    ```bash
    kubectl logs -l app=attacker-pod -n attacker
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** Retrieve and analyze the logs of the malicious backend.
    *   **Why:** To observe the request headers and potentially the data transmitted. This confirms the data is being redirected through the malicious backend.
    *   **Expected Output:** The logs from the nginx instance will show a request to `/api/sensitive-data`.

**Potential Variations and Alternative Approaches:**

*   **Host Header Injection:** Try injecting extra `Host` headers with conflicting values. The Ingress controller might prioritize the first or last `Host` header, leading to unexpected routing.
*   **X-Forwarded-Host Header:**  If the Ingress controller uses the `X-Forwarded-Host` header, try manipulating it.
*   **TLS/SSL Stripping:** If the Ingress is only secured with HTTP, try forcing HTTPS requests with a malicious `Host` header to see if the Ingress fails to handle the request properly or leaks information.
*   **WebSocket Hijacking:**  If the targeted application uses WebSockets, try upgrading the connection with a malicious `Host` header to hijack the WebSocket session.
*   **Testing with different Ingress controllers:** Different Ingress controllers might have different vulnerabilities related to Host header handling. Try the same techniques against Ingress controllers such as Nginx Ingress Controller, Traefik, or Kong.
*  **Use the ingress-dns name instead of IP**: Substitute the INGRESS_ADDRESS with the DNS record assigned to the Ingress controller. This can reveal different behavior regarding the host header verification.
* **Bypass TLS:** The attacker can manipulate the `Host` header to redirect the victim's request to a non-TLS endpoint, potentially exposing the communication to eavesdropping.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Explicit Host Definitions:** Define explicit hostnames for each Ingress resource instead of relying on wildcard domains or missing host definitions.
*   **Host Header Validation:** Implement strict validation of the `Host` header at the Ingress controller level.  Use allowlists of valid hostnames and reject requests with invalid or unexpected `Host` headers.
*   **Sanitize the Host Header:** Sanitize the `Host` header to prevent injection attacks and ensure it matches the expected format.
*   **Use Strong TLS Configuration:** Enforce HTTPS and configure strong TLS settings for all Ingress resources to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Perform regular security audits of the Ingress controller configuration and application code to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to Ingress controllers and application components.
*   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to mitigate DoS attacks caused by traffic redirection.
*   **Update Ingress Controller:** Keep the Ingress controller updated to the latest version to patch any known vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Policies:** Implement Network Policies to restrict communication between pods and limit the impact of a successful backend poisoning attack.
*   **Monitor Ingress Controller Logs:** Regularly monitor Ingress controller logs for suspicious activity, such as unexpected `Host` header values or traffic patterns.
