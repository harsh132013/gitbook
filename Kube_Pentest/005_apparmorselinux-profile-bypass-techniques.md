# Kubernetes AppArmor/SELinux Profile Bypass Vulnerability

## 1. Overview Section

**Attack Vector Description:**

This vulnerability involves bypassing the security controls enforced by AppArmor or SELinux profiles configured for Kubernetes pods.  An attacker who can exploit a weakness within a pod's application, or leverage misconfigurations in the container runtime or kernel, can potentially escape the profile's restrictions and gain unauthorized access to the host system or other pods. This can be achieved by exploiting capabilities, syscalls, or file access patterns not adequately restricted by the profile, or by triggering vulnerabilities in the container runtime itself.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

A successful AppArmor/SELinux profile bypass can have severe consequences, including:

*   **Host System Compromise:**  The attacker could gain root access to the underlying host system, allowing them to control the entire Kubernetes node.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker could pivot from the compromised pod to other pods within the cluster, gaining access to sensitive data and resources.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker could exfiltrate sensitive data stored within the cluster.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt the availability of applications and services running on the cluster.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker could elevate privileges within the cluster, potentially gaining cluster administrator rights.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

**Critical/High**. The risk level is high because a successful bypass can lead to full system compromise and significant disruption. If the attacker has control of the image, deployment or is able to exploit a vulnerability that gives them control of the container the risk level is critical.

**Technical Explanation:**

AppArmor and SELinux are Linux kernel security modules that provide Mandatory Access Control (MAC).  They work by defining profiles that restrict the actions a process (in this case, a container) can perform. These profiles specify allowed system calls, file access, and network capabilities.  Vulnerabilities arise when:

*   **Profiles are overly permissive:**  If the profile allows too many system calls or file access, an attacker can leverage these allowed actions to perform malicious activities.
*   **Profiles are incomplete:** If the profiles do not properly restrict the capabilities or access required by the running workload the application could leverage these capabilities to bypass controls.
*   **Container runtime vulnerabilities:** Bugs in the container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) can allow an attacker to escape the container's restrictions, regardless of the AppArmor/SELinux profile.
*   **Kernel vulnerabilities:** Kernel vulnerabilities such as Dirty Pipe can allow for privilege escalation within a container, allowing an attacker to bypass the AppArmor/SELinux profile.
*   **Incorrectly configured profiles:** Malformed or incorrectly configured profiles may prevent them from properly restricting access.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   **Vulnerable Application:**  A vulnerable application running within a container that can be exploited (e.g., command injection, arbitrary file write).
*   **Knowledge of AppArmor/SELinux Profile:**  Understanding the specifics of the AppArmor or SELinux profile applied to the container is beneficial. This can be obtained through introspection tools (described below).
*   **Access to the Kubernetes cluster:** The attacker needs some level of access to the Kubernetes cluster, whether as a developer, user with `kubectl` access, or an external attacker who has gained access to a node.
*   **Capability to execute commands inside a container:** The ability to run commands inside the target container (e.g., via `kubectl exec` or a reverse shell).
*   **Container runtime with vulnerable configuration:** Some container runtimes may have a configuration that can be exploited.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

We will demonstrate a potential AppArmor bypass using a command injection vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands as the host user, assuming the AppArmor profile is insufficiently restrictive.

**Phase 1: Information Gathering and Validation**

**Step 1: Gain Access to the Container**

We assume we have already identified a vulnerable pod and have the ability to execute commands inside it.  In a real scenario, this might involve exploiting a command injection vulnerability in a web application running within the pod.

```bash
kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n <namespace> -- /bin/bash
```

*   **Explanation:** This command uses `kubectl exec` to execute an interactive bash shell inside the specified pod in the specified namespace.
*   **Why:** This provides the attacker with a shell inside the container, allowing them to run commands and inspect the environment.
*   **Expected Output:** A bash prompt inside the container.

**Step 2: Identify the AppArmor Profile (if any)**

```bash
cat /proc/self/attr/current
```

*   **Explanation:** This command reads the contents of the `/proc/self/attr/current` file, which contains the AppArmor profile currently applied to the process.
*   **Why:** This helps determine if an AppArmor profile is in place and, if so, its name.
*   **Expected Output:** If AppArmor is enabled, the output will be the name of the AppArmor profile.  If AppArmor is not enabled, the output will be "unconfined".  If SELinux is enabled, this may show `unconfined` and you should use the next command instead.
*   **Variations:** If `/proc/self/attr/current` doesn't exist, AppArmor might not be enabled.  Alternatively, the process might not have an AppArmor profile applied.  If this output is "unconfined", AppArmor is disabled or not properly configured for the container.

**Step 3: Identifying SELinux Profile (if any)**

```bash
cat /proc/self/attr/execdomain
```

*   **Explanation:** This command reads the contents of the `/proc/self/attr/execdomain` file, which contains the SELinux domain currently applied to the process.
*   **Why:** This helps determine if an SELinux domain is in place and, if so, its name.
*   **Expected Output:** If SELinux is enabled, the output will be the name of the SELinux domain. If SELinux is not enabled, or if the SELinux domain has not been properly configured, the output will be "unconfined".

**Step 4: Enumerate Capabilities**

```bash
capsh --print
```

*   **Explanation:** This command uses `capsh` to display the Linux capabilities currently enabled for the process.
*   **Why:**  Understanding the allowed capabilities is crucial because some capabilities can be used to bypass security restrictions.
*   **Expected Output:** A list of capabilities granted to the process.  Look for capabilities like `cap_sys_module`, `cap_dac_override`, `cap_dac_read_search`, `cap_sys_admin`, and `cap_net_admin`. If many are enabled this could be a sign of a permissive profile.
*   **Variations:**  If `capsh` is not available, you may need to install it using `apt-get update && apt-get install libcap2-bin` or similar, depending on the container's base image.

**Phase 2: Exploitation**

The following steps demonstrate a potential bypass by attempting to mount a file system. This technique can be effective if the AppArmor/SELinux profile is not properly restricting `mount` syscall or access to `/dev/sd*` devices.

**Step 5: Attempt to Mount a Host Device**

```bash
mkdir /mnt/host
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/host
```

*   **Explanation:** This command attempts to mount the first partition of the first SATA drive (`/dev/sda1`) onto the `/mnt/host` directory inside the container.
*   **Why:** If successful, this will give the container read/write access to the host system's file system.  This is a classic bypass technique because it directly exposes the host.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   **Success:** If successful, the command will complete without errors.  You can then navigate to `/mnt/host` and explore the host's file system.
    *   **Failure (AppArmor/SELinux preventing the mount):**  You will receive an error message indicating permission denied, typically related to AppArmor or SELinux. For example: `mount: /mnt/host: permission denied`.
    *   **Failure (Device not found):**  An error like `mount: /dev/sda1: No such device or address` means that device is not available. You may need to enumerate block devices using `lsblk` and try other partitions.

**Step 6: (If Mount Successful) Access Host Files**

```bash
ls /mnt/host/etc/shadow
cat /mnt/host/etc/shadow
```

*   **Explanation:** These commands list the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file on the host and then attempt to read it.
*   **Why:**  Reading `/etc/shadow` is a clear indicator of a successful bypass, as it contains sensitive password hashes.
*   **Expected Output:**
    *   **Success:** The contents of `/etc/shadow` will be displayed.
    *   **Failure (Permission Denied on Host FS):**  Even if the mount succeeds, AppArmor/SELinux on the host *might* still prevent access to certain files.  This is less common but possible.

**Alternative Bypass Techniques:**

The above is one potential bypass. Other techniques include:

*   **Exploiting Kernel Vulnerabilities:**  If the kernel is vulnerable (e.g., Dirty Pipe), an attacker can use it to gain root privileges within the container, effectively bypassing the AppArmor/SELinux profile.
*   **Abusing Capabilities:**  Capabilities like `cap_sys_module` can be used to load kernel modules, which can then be used to compromise the host.
*   **Exploiting Command Injection:** A command injection vulnerability in the pod application can be used to directly run system commands, bypassing the intended restriction.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:**  Create AppArmor/SELinux profiles that grant only the necessary permissions to the container.  Avoid overly permissive profiles.
*   **Regularly Review and Update Profiles:**  Review and update AppArmor/SELinux profiles as application requirements change and new vulnerabilities are discovered.
*   **Keep Container Runtimes and Kernels Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update the container runtime and kernel to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Implement Strong Input Validation:**  Implement robust input validation in applications to prevent command injection and other vulnerabilities.
*   **Use Container Scanning Tools:** Use container scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in container images.
*   **Enable Runtime Security Monitoring:** Implement runtime security monitoring to detect and respond to suspicious activity within containers.
*   **Use Kubernetes Network Policies:** Use Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict network traffic between pods, limiting the impact of a successful bypass.
*   **Harden the Host System:** Ensure the host operating system is properly hardened and patched.
*   **Audit the Pod Security Context:** Ensure that pod security context is properly set and that unnecessary privileges are not granted to the container.
