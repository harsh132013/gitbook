# Kubernetes Multi-Stage Build Secret Leakage Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

This document details the "Multi-Stage Build Secret Leakage" vulnerability in Kubernetes, which can occur when secrets are inadvertently included in intermediary build stages and then exposed in the final container image.

### Attack Vector Description

An attacker can extract sensitive information (secrets, credentials, API keys, etc.) from a container image built using multi-stage Dockerfiles if secrets are copied or used in an intermediate layer but not explicitly removed or overwritten before the final image is created. Because Docker images are layered, even if the secret is removed later, it might still exist in a previous layer. This allows an attacker with access to the image (e.g., through a container registry) to reconstruct the secret from these layers.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

*   **Data Breach:** Exposure of sensitive data (passwords, API keys, database credentials) leading to unauthorized access to systems and data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Compromised credentials can be used to escalate privileges within the Kubernetes cluster or external systems.
*   **Service Disruption:** Misuse of exposed API keys can lead to service disruption or denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Public disclosure of a security breach can damage the organization's reputation.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical**

### Technical Explanation

Docker images are built in layers. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. Multi-stage builds allow using different base images for different stages of the build process.  A common pitfall is copying secrets into an intermediate stage for tasks like building dependencies or running tests, but failing to remove or overwrite them before finalizing the image in the final `FROM` stage. This results in the secret persisting in one of the image's layers.  Because of the layered file system in Docker, even deleting a file in a later layer doesn't truly remove it from the image; it merely masks its existence.  An attacker can still retrieve the file from the earlier layer.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   Access to a container image vulnerable to this issue (e.g., through a public or private container registry).
*   Docker installed on the attacker's machine.
*   Basic understanding of Dockerfiles and multi-stage builds.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

### Phase 1: Image Inspection and Validation

1.  **Pull the Target Image:** Pull the potentially vulnerable image from the registry.

    ```bash
    docker pull <registry>/<image>:<tag>
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command downloads the target Docker image to the attacker's local machine.  Replace `<registry>/<image>:<tag>` with the actual location and tag of the image. For example: `docker pull my-private-registry/my-app:latest`
    *   **Expected Output:**  Docker pulling the image layers.
    *   **Contribution:**  Allows for local analysis of the image.

2.  **Create a Container from the Image:** Create a container from the downloaded image.  This isn't to *run* the container; it's just to get its ID for subsequent operations.

    ```bash
    docker create <registry>/<image>:<tag>
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  `docker create` creates a writable layer over the specified image, preparing it for running. We use this only to get the container ID.
    *   **Expected Output:**  A long hexadecimal string representing the container ID.
    *   **Contribution:**  Provides the container ID necessary to inspect the image layers.

3.  **Inspect the Container for Layer Information:** Use `docker image inspect` to obtain the image's history and layer IDs.  We'll use the container ID to pinpoint this specific instantiation.

    ```bash
    docker inspect <registry>/<image>:<tag> --format='{{.RootFS.Layers}}'
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  This command retrieves the layers that make up the Docker image.  The `--format` option specifies that we only want the `RootFS.Layers` section, which contains the layer IDs.
    *   **Expected Output:**  A JSON array of layer IDs (SHA256 hashes).  For example: `[sha256:aaaa... sha256:bbbb... sha256:cccc...]`
    *   **Contribution:**  Provides a list of layers to inspect individually.

4.  **Examine Each Layer's Content:** Extract the contents of each layer using `docker export` combined with `tar` and `zstd`.  Iterate through each layer ID obtained in the previous step. Note that modern Docker uses `zstd` for compression, older ones might use `gzip` or `bzip2`. You can adapt the script accordingly.

    ```bash
    LAYER_IDS=($(docker inspect <registry>/<image>:<tag> --format='{{.RootFS.Layers}}' | jq -r '.[][0]')) # Using jq to extract the IDs
    for LAYER_ID in "${LAYER_IDS[@]}"; do
      echo "Inspecting layer: $LAYER_ID"
      docker image save "$LAYER_ID" | tar -xOz | zstd -d | tar -xvf -
      # Optionally, grep for sensitive keywords
      find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -iE 'password|secret|api_key|credentials|token'
    done
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**
        *   The first line retrieves the layer IDs and stores them in the `LAYER_IDS` array using `jq` for easier parsing.
        *   The `for` loop iterates through each layer ID.
        *   `docker image save "$LAYER_ID"` saves the specific layer as a tar archive.
        *   `tar -xOz` extracts the archive to standard output without creating any files on disk.
        *   `zstd -d` decompresses the output (assuming zstd compression).  Adjust if `gzip` or `bzip2` is needed.
        *   `tar -xvf -` extracts the decompressed output.
        *   `find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -iE 'password|secret|api_key|credentials|token'`  searches within the extracted files for common sensitive keywords.  This is an optional step to quickly identify potentially leaked secrets.

    *   **Expected Output:**  The files contained in each layer will be extracted to the current directory.  The `grep` command will print any lines containing the searched keywords, along with the filename where they were found.
    *   **Contribution:**  Reveals the contents of each layer, allowing to check for leaked secrets.

### Phase 2: Exploitation (If Vulnerability is Found)

If a secret is identified in one of the image layers:

1.  **Locate the Leaked Secret:** Identify the exact file and line number where the secret is stored.

    ```bash
    # Example: If the secret was found in a file named "config.ini" in the layer "sha256:xxxx..."
    cat ./config.ini
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command displays the contents of the file containing the leaked secret. Replace `./config.ini` with the actual path to the file.
    *   **Expected Output:**  The contents of `config.ini`, including the leaked secret value.
    *   **Contribution:**  Confirms the presence and value of the leaked secret.

2.  **Leverage the Secret:** Depending on the nature of the secret, use it to gain unauthorized access or perform other malicious actions.

    *   **Example 1 (API Key):** Use the API key to access a protected API endpoint.

        ```bash
        curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" https://example.com/api/sensitive_data
        ```

    *   **Example 2 (Database Credentials):** Use the database credentials to connect to the database.

        ```bash
        mysql -h <DATABASE_HOST> -u <USERNAME> -p"<PASSWORD>" <DATABASE_NAME>
        ```

    *   **Explanation:** These commands demonstrate how to use the leaked secret to access restricted resources. Replace the placeholders with the actual values and the appropriate command for the target system.
    *   **Expected Output:**  Successful access to the protected resource, indicating successful exploitation.
    *   **Contribution:** Demonstrates the real-world impact of the vulnerability.

### Remediation Recommendations

1.  **Use `.dockerignore`:**  Ensure that sensitive files and directories (e.g., `.env`, `.ssh`, certificates) are excluded from the image build process by adding them to the `.dockerignore` file.

2.  **Avoid Copying Secrets Directly:** Do not copy secret files directly into the image.  Use alternative methods for injecting secrets at runtime, such as:
    *   **Kubernetes Secrets:** Store secrets in Kubernetes Secrets and mount them as files or environment variables into the container at runtime.
    *   **Environment Variables:**  Pass secrets as environment variables during container startup, taking care not to hardcode them into the Dockerfile.
    *   **Secret Management Tools (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager):** Use a dedicated secret management solution to securely store and retrieve secrets.

3.  **Multi-Stage Build Best Practices:** When using multi-stage builds, carefully manage secrets in intermediate stages. Ensure that any secrets used in an intermediate stage are explicitly removed or overwritten before the final image is created.  Consider using a scratch image for the final stage to ensure a minimal attack surface.

    ```dockerfile
    FROM ubuntu as builder
    # ... build steps that might use a secret ...
    RUN rm -rf /path/to/secret # Explicitly remove the secret

    FROM scratch # Final stage, starting from an empty image.  Requires all dependencies to be explicitly copied from the builder stage.
    COPY --from=builder /app /app
    # ...
    ```

4.  **Image Scanning:** Implement automated image scanning as part of the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential secret leakage and other vulnerabilities.  Tools like Trivy, Clair, and Anchore can help identify these issues.

5.  **Regular Image Audits:** Conduct regular audits of existing container images to identify and address any potential security vulnerabilities.
