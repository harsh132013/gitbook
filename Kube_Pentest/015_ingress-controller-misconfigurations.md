# Kubernetes Ingress Controller Misconfiguration Vulnerability

## 1. Overview

**Attack Vector Description:** Ingress controllers, while essential for routing external traffic to Kubernetes services, can be misconfigured, leading to various vulnerabilities. This documentation focuses on common misconfigurations, including insecure defaults, path-based routing bypasses, and TLS/SSL certificate management issues, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to services or compromise the entire cluster.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Services:** Attackers can bypass intended security controls and access sensitive services that should not be publicly accessible.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive data transmitted to or from compromised services can be intercepted by the attacker.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Malicious actors can leverage misconfigurations to overload services or the Ingress controller itself, causing a denial of service.
*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal credentials used by the compromised services.
*   **Cluster Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers might escalate privileges from compromised services to other components within the Kubernetes cluster, leading to full cluster takeover.

**Risk Level Assessment:** High (depending on the severity of the misconfiguration and the sensitivity of the affected services).

**Technical Explanation:** Ingress controllers route external traffic based on rules defined in Ingress resources. Misconfigurations can occur due to:

*   **Insecure Defaults:** Ingress controller default settings may not enforce strong security policies.
*   **Overly Permissive Path-Based Routing:** Rules might allow unintended path-based routing bypasses, granting access to unauthorized resources.
*   **TLS/SSL Certificate Issues:** Weak cipher suites, expired certificates, or missing SSL/TLS configuration can expose the cluster to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Missing Authentication/Authorization:** The ingress controller may lack proper authentication/authorization mechanisms, allowing unauthenticated access to resources.
*   **Open Ports/Services:** Exposing unnecessary ports or services can create additional attack surfaces.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   Access to the Kubernetes cluster network (e.g., from a host within the cluster or a host with network connectivity to the cluster).
*   Knowledge of the Ingress controller being used (e.g., Nginx Ingress Controller, Traefik, HAProxy Ingress).
*   `kubectl` configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
*   Basic understanding of Kubernetes Ingress resources and services.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

This section demonstrates an example of exploiting a path-based routing misconfiguration in an Nginx Ingress Controller where a wildcard path allows access to a protected resource.

**Phase 1: Reconnaissance and Information Gathering**

**Step 1: List Ingress Resources**

```bash
kubectl get ingress -n default
```

**Explanation:** This command lists all Ingress resources in the `default` namespace. It helps identify potential targets and their configurations.
**Expected Output:** A table showing the Ingress resources, including their names, hosts, and associated rules.
**Why:** Identifying Ingress resources is the first step to understand how external traffic is routed to services within the cluster.

**Step 2: Describe a Specific Ingress Resource**

```bash
kubectl describe ingress <ingress_name> -n default
```

**Explanation:** Replace `<ingress_name>` with the name of the Ingress resource identified in the previous step. This command provides detailed information about the Ingress resource, including its rules, backend services, and annotations.
**Expected Output:** A detailed description of the Ingress resource, revealing its configuration and rules. Look for potentially insecure path-based routing or wildcard entries.
**Why:** Understanding the rules associated with the Ingress resource is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities.

**Step 3: Identify Services behind the Ingress**

```bash
kubectl get services -n default
```

**Explanation:** This command lists all services in the `default` namespace. Compare these services with the backend services specified in the Ingress resource description (from Step 2).
**Expected Output:** A list of services.  Match the service names from the Ingress resource description.
**Why:** To understand what services are exposed and how they are routed.

**Phase 2: Vulnerability Validation (Wildcard Path Exploitation)**

**Step 4: Validate Exploitable Wildcard**

Assume the `kubectl describe ingress <ingress_name>` output reveals the following rule:

```yaml
rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: web-app
          servicePort: 80
        path: /app/*
        pathType: Prefix
```

Let's say the `web-app` service is a regular web application but access to `/app/admin` should be restricted via authentication implemented by the application. The wildcard `*` might allow bypassing this protection if the Ingress controller simply forwards the request without enforcing additional security.

```bash
curl -H "Host: example.com" http://<ingress_controller_ip>/app/admin
```

**Explanation:** This command sends an HTTP request to the Ingress controller IP address, targeting the `/app/admin` path. The `Host` header is set to `example.com` to match the Ingress rule.
**Expected Output:** If successful, the applicationâ€™s admin page will be served.
**Why:** To confirm access to a potentially restricted area.
**Variation:** Test with different paths like `/app/admin/config` or `/app/admin/secrets` to potentially uncover sensitive information.

**Phase 3: Exploitation and Impact Assessment**

**Step 5: Evaluate Access to other potentially restricted routes**

```bash
curl -H "Host: example.com" http://<ingress_controller_ip>/app/../../etc/passwd
```

**Explanation:** This attempts to use a path traversal attack to access system files, specifically the `/etc/passwd` file on the application server.  This works if the application handles the `/` after `/app/` or if the ingress controller is vulnerable to path traversal.
**Expected Output:** If successful, the /etc/passwd file content is displayed. This confirms severe misconfiguration allowing unrestricted file access.
**Why:** Assessing the extent of the vulnerability and the level of access gained.

**Step 6: Retrieve Sensitive Configuration Data**

If the `/app/admin` path leads to a configuration page, you might be able to retrieve sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets stored in the application's configuration. Analyze the page source and network requests to identify these potential vulnerabilities. For example:

```bash
curl -H "Host: example.com" http://<ingress_controller_ip>/app/admin | grep -i "password"
```

**Explanation:** This command retrieves the content of the admin page and uses `grep` to search for keywords like "password" or "api_key" that might indicate the presence of sensitive information.
**Expected Output:** Lines containing sensitive information, confirming the exposure of critical data.
**Why:** Demonstrate the real-world impact of the vulnerability, highlighting the potential for data breaches.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Use precise path matching instead of wildcards:**  Avoid wildcard paths like `/app/*`.  Implement stricter path definitions, for example, `/app/products`, `/app/services`, etc.
*   **Implement proper authentication and authorization:**  Always require authentication for sensitive paths (e.g., `/app/admin`). Implement strong authorization policies to restrict access to authorized users only. Consider external authentication providers like OAuth2 or OpenID Connect.
*   **Regularly update your Ingress controller:** Keep your Ingress controller software up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure the underlying services:** Enforce authentication and authorization on the backend services themselves, not just rely on the Ingress controller.
*   **Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Use a WAF to provide an additional layer of security and protect against common web application attacks.
*   **Implement strict network policies:** Define network policies that restrict traffic flow within the Kubernetes cluster, limiting the impact of a compromised service.

**Phase 4: Reporting and Documentation**

Create a detailed report summarizing the findings, including the vulnerability description, exploitation steps, impact assessment, and remediation recommendations. This documentation should be clear, concise, and reproducible.
