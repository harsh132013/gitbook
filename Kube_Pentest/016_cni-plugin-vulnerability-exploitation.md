# Kubernetes CNI Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation

## 1. Overview Section

This document details the exploitation of vulnerabilities within Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins. CNI plugins are responsible for network configuration within Kubernetes, including assigning IP addresses to pods and connecting them to the cluster network. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can grant attackers significant control over the cluster network and the pods running within it.

**Attack Vector Description:**

The attack vector involves leveraging weaknesses in how CNI plugins handle network configuration requests, typically involving manipulating configuration files, injecting malicious network policies, or exploiting flaws in the plugin's binary or scripts.  An attacker might target a misconfigured or outdated CNI plugin, or exploit a vulnerability discovered in the plugin's code. Specifically, this document focuses on a scenario where an attacker can modify the CNI configuration file to redirect pod traffic.

**Potential Impact and Consequences:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Redirecting pod traffic allows an attacker to intercept sensitive data transmitted between pods, including credentials, API keys, and personally identifiable information (PII).
*   **Pod Impersonation:**  Altering network routes can allow an attacker to impersonate a pod and gain unauthorized access to resources it is authorized to access.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Incorrect network configurations can disrupt communication between pods, leading to application instability and downtime.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Successfully compromising a pod via network redirection can facilitate lateral movement within the cluster, allowing the attacker to access other pods and nodes.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Intercepting and analyzing pod traffic can expose sensitive data that can be exfiltrated from the cluster.

**Risk Level Assessment:**

**Critical** - Successful exploitation grants the attacker control over network traffic, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and significant disruption of service.

**Technical Explanation of Why This Vulnerability Exists:**

This vulnerability stems from insufficient validation and sanitization of CNI configuration files. The CNI plugin reads these files to determine how to configure the network for pods. If an attacker can modify these files to insert malicious routing rules or other network settings, they can redirect traffic to their own controlled pods. This can arise from misconfigured permissions on the CNI configuration directory, insecure default configurations, or flaws in the CNI plugin itself (e.g., a buffer overflow allowing arbitrary file writes when processing a CNI configuration). Another potential cause can be related to how the CNI plugin interfaces with network namespaces, enabling arbitrary network operations.

**Prerequisites and Conditions Needed:**

*   **Access to the CNI Configuration Directory:** The attacker needs write access to the CNI configuration directory on the node (typically `/etc/cni/net.d/`). This can be achieved through node compromise, a privileged container escape, or vulnerabilities in the kubelet configuration.
*   **Understanding of CNI Configuration Format:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of the CNI configuration file format (typically JSON).
*   **Knowledge of Network Namespaces:** The attacker needs understanding of Linux network namespaces to route the traffic as expected.
*   **Running Pods within the Kubernetes Cluster:** The cluster needs active pods with network traffic to intercept.
*   **(Optional) Knowledge of Target Pods:**  Knowing the intended destination pods for the intercepted traffic allows for more targeted and effective attacks.

## 2. Validation and Exploitation Steps Section

The following steps outline how to validate the existence of this vulnerability and exploit it for man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. We'll assume the attacker has gained access to the node's filesystem and has the ability to write to the CNI configuration directory `/etc/cni/net.d/`.

**Step 1: Identify the CNI Configuration File**

```bash
ls /etc/cni/net.d/
```

*   **Explanation:** This command lists the files in the CNI configuration directory.
*   **Why:** We need to identify the configuration file used by the CNI plugin to configure the network. This file will typically have a `.conf`, `.conflist`, or `.json` extension.  For example, `10-calico.conflist`.
*   **Expected Output:** A list of files in the directory, including at least one configuration file.
*   **What to Look For:** The name of the CNI configuration file. The name usually reflects the CNI plugin being used (e.g., calico, flannel, weave-net).
*   **Variation:** The CNI config location might differ based on the Kubernetes distribution. Check `kubelet --help` for configuration details on specific CNI configuration location.
*   **Contribution:**  Identifies the target configuration file for modification.

**Step 2: Backup the Original CNI Configuration File**

```bash
cp /etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist /tmp/10-calico.conflist.bak
```

*   **Explanation:** This command creates a backup of the original CNI configuration file.  Replace `10-calico.conflist` with the actual filename identified in Step 1.
*   **Why:** Backing up the original file is crucial for reverting the changes after the exploitation, minimizing disruption to the cluster.
*   **Expected Output:** No output if the command is successful.
*   **What to Look For:** Ensure the file `/tmp/10-calico.conflist.bak` exists after execution.
*   **Variation:** Backup to `/root` if `/tmp` is not accessible.
*   **Contribution:** Provides a fallback mechanism if the exploitation fails or needs to be rolled back.

**Step 3: Inspect the CNI Configuration File**

```bash
cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist
```

*   **Explanation:** This command displays the content of the CNI configuration file. Replace `10-calico.conflist` with the actual filename.
*   **Why:** Inspecting the file allows us to understand its structure and identify the sections we need to modify.  Pay attention to the `ipam` and `plugins` sections.
*   **Expected Output:** The content of the CNI configuration file in JSON format.
*   **What to Look For:**  The IP address allocation settings (`ipam`) and any routing or firewall rules (`plugins`). Look for the gateway IP address and network settings.
*   **Variation:** Use `jq . /etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist` for a more readable and structured view if `jq` is available.
*   **Contribution:** Provides the context needed to modify the configuration file effectively.

**Step 4: Create a Malicious CNI Configuration File**

This step requires creating a malicious CNI configuration file. The specific content will depend on the CNI plugin and the desired attack vector. Here, we'll inject a `tuning` plugin to modify the routing table and redirect traffic to a pod controlled by the attacker.

We'll assume the attacker has a pod running at IP address `10.244.1.5` and wants to intercept all traffic destined for pod `10.244.2.10`.

```json
{
    "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
    "name": "mynet",
    "plugins": [
        {
            "type": "calico",
            "log_level": "info",
            "datastore_type": "kubernetes",
            "nodename": "k8s-node",
            "ipam": {
                "type": "calico-ipam"
            },
            "policy": {
                "type": "k8s"
            },
            "kubernetes": {
                "kubeconfig": "/etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conf"
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "tuning",
            "someSetting": "arbitrary",
            "routes": [
                {
                    "dst": "10.244.2.10/32",
                    "gw": "10.244.1.5"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
          "type": "portmap",
          "capabilities": {"portMappings": true}
        }
    ]
}
```

*   **Explanation:** This JSON configuration defines a CNI configuration that includes the original `calico` configuration followed by a custom `tuning` plugin.  The `tuning` plugin is used to inject a new routing rule.  The portmap plugin allows for hostport binding.
*   **Why:**  The injected route redirects all traffic destined for `10.244.2.10` to the attacker's pod at `10.244.1.5`. The `tuning` plugin is an example. Replace this with an exploit of the CNI plugin if it contains a vulnerable component, such as a binary.
*   **Expected Output:**  A valid CNI configuration file.
*   **What to Look For:**  The `routes` array within the `tuning` section. The `dst` should match the target pod's IP address, and the `gw` should match the attacker's pod's IP address.
*   **Variation:**  The `tuning` plugin is illustrative. The attacker might use a different method of manipulating the routing table or network configuration, depending on the CNI plugin's capabilities.  For example, some CNI plugins might allow defining custom network policies that can be abused.
*   **Contribution:** This malicious configuration is the core of the exploit, allowing the attacker to redirect network traffic.

**Step 5: Replace the Original Configuration File**

```bash
echo '{  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",  "name": "mynet",  "plugins": [   {    "type": "calico",    "log_level": "info",    "datastore_type": "kubernetes",    "nodename": "k8s-node",    "ipam": {     "type": "calico-ipam"    },    "policy": {     "type": "k8s"    },    "kubernetes": {     "kubeconfig": "/etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conf"    }   },   {    "type": "tuning",    "someSetting": "arbitrary",    "routes": [     {      "dst": "10.244.2.10/32",      "gw": "10.244.1.5"     }    ]   },   {    "type": "portmap",    "capabilities": {"portMappings": true}   }  ] }' > /etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist
```

*   **Explanation:** This command overwrites the original CNI configuration file with the malicious configuration created in Step 4.  Replace `10-calico.conflist` with the actual filename.
*   **Why:** This activates the malicious configuration, causing traffic to be redirected.
*   **Expected Output:** No output if the command is successful.
*   **What to Look For:**  Verify that the file `/etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist` now contains the malicious configuration.
*   **Variation:**  Use `cat malicious.json > /etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist` if the configuration is stored in a separate file.
*   **Contribution:** Implements the core of the attack by replacing the legitimate configuration with a malicious one.

**Step 6: Trigger a Pod Re-creation or Network Configuration Update**

The changes made to the CNI configuration file will not take effect immediately. You need to trigger a pod re-creation or network configuration update.  One common way to do this is to restart the kubelet service.

```bash
systemctl restart kubelet
```

*   **Explanation:** This command restarts the kubelet service.
*   **Why:** Restarting the kubelet forces it to re-read the CNI configuration and reconfigure the network for the pods. This is the quickest method, although it can disrupt other pods. Another approach is to delete and recreate the target pod, which is less disruptive but might not always be feasible.
*   **Expected Output:** No output if the command is successful. The cluster nodes may experience brief networking interruptions.
*   **What to Look For:**  Verify that the kubelet service restarts without errors.
*   **Variation:** Different Kubernetes distributions may use different methods for restarting the kubelet.  Check the relevant documentation. You may need `sudo` before this command.  If restarting is not possible or desired, deleting and recreating the target pod is an alternative: `kubectl delete pod <target-pod> -n <namespace>` followed by `kubectl apply -f <pod-definition.yaml> -n <namespace>`.
*   **Contribution:** Ensures that the malicious CNI configuration takes effect.

**Step 7: Validate Traffic Redirection (MitM)**

From the attacker's pod (`10.244.1.5`), monitor the network traffic to confirm that traffic destined for `10.244.2.10` is being intercepted. This can be done using tools like `tcpdump` or `wireshark` within the attacker's pod.

```bash
# Inside the attacker's pod (10.244.1.5):
tcpdump -i any -n host 10.244.2.10
```

*   **Explanation:** This command captures all network packets on all interfaces of the attacker's pod that have a source or destination IP address of `10.244.2.10`.
*   **Why:** This confirms that traffic intended for the target pod is being redirected to the attacker's pod.
*   **Expected Output:** The `tcpdump` output should show packets being received at the attacker's pod that were originally destined for `10.244.2.10`.
*   **What to Look For:** Packets with a destination IP address of `10.244.2.10` appearing in the `tcpdump` output.
*   **Variation:** Use `wireshark` for a more detailed analysis of the captured traffic. If the traffic is encrypted, the attacker would need to compromise the target pod to obtain the decryption keys.
*   **Contribution:** Verifies the successful exploitation of the CNI plugin vulnerability and the establishment of a MitM attack.

**Step 8: Clean up (Restore the Original Configuration)**

After successfully demonstrating the vulnerability, it's crucial to restore the original CNI configuration to avoid disrupting the cluster.

```bash
cp /tmp/10-calico.conflist.bak /etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist
systemctl restart kubelet
```

*   **Explanation:** This command restores the original CNI configuration from the backup created in Step 2.  Replace `10-calico.conflist` with the actual filename.  Then restarts the kubelet service.
*   **Why:** Reverts the changes made during the exploitation, restoring the cluster to its original state.
*   **Expected Output:** No output if the command is successful. The cluster nodes may experience brief networking interruptions again.
*   **What to Look For:**  Verify that the file `/etc/cni/net.d/10-calico.conflist` now contains the original configuration. Also verify that traffic to `10.244.2.10` is no longer being redirected to the attacker's pod.
*   **Variation:** If restarting the kubelet is disruptive, consider deleting and recreating affected pods instead, but ensure the old network configuration is removed before recreation.
*   **Contribution:** Mitigates the impact of the exploitation and returns the cluster to its normal operational state.

## Remediation Recommendations

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Restrict access to the CNI configuration directory (`/etc/cni/net.d/`) to only the kubelet and other necessary system processes. Use appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized modification.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the Kubernetes cluster configuration, including the CNI plugin configuration, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Keep CNI Plugins Up-to-Date:**  Ensure that the CNI plugin is running the latest version with all security patches applied. Monitor the CNI plugin's security advisories for any known vulnerabilities.
*   **Configuration File Integrity Monitoring:**  Implement a system to monitor the integrity of the CNI configuration files. Any unauthorized modification should trigger an alert.  Consider using tools like `auditd` or file integrity monitoring systems.
*   **Network Policies:**  Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict network traffic between pods. This can prevent attackers from exploiting network redirection vulnerabilities to access sensitive resources. Network policies should define the allowed ingress and egress traffic for each pod, limiting the impact of a compromised pod.
*   **Input Validation:**  Ensure that CNI plugins perform thorough validation and sanitization of all input data, including configuration files. This can prevent attackers from injecting malicious code or configurations.
*   **Container Security Hardening:**  Harden container images and runtime environments to reduce the attack surface. Use minimal base images, disable unnecessary services, and apply security best practices for container security.
*   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):**  Deploy IDPS solutions that can detect and prevent malicious network activity within the Kubernetes cluster. These systems can monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns and block attacks in real-time.
*   **Runtime Security:** Use runtime security tools to monitor container behavior and detect suspicious activities. These tools can identify malicious processes, file modifications, and network connections, and can prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in real-time.
